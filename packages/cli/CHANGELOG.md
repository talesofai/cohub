# @neta-art/cohub-cli

## 6.5.0

### Minor Changes

- 0cd4d32: Turn browsing now matches the Web session view:
  
  - `spaces turns ls --session <sessionId>` lists full turns from one session (the same endpoint the Web session view uses), with `--cursor <sequence>` and `--direction older|newer` pagination.
  - New `spaces turns intermediate <sessionId> <turnId>` command reads a turn's persisted intermediate messages from its CDN archive; `--json` returns the raw archive without reducing its content blocks.

### Patch Changes

- Updated dependencies [9275e77]
- Updated dependencies [0cd4d32]
  - @neta-art/cohub@8.8.0

## 6.4.0

### Minor Changes

- f9b6156: Board CLI improvements:
  
  - `boards create` now reports the created Board file path (including in JSON output).
  - `boards items list/get` show derived layout columns (x/y/width/height) for draw and arrow items.
  - Board example templates are updated to the normalized geometry authoring format.

### Patch Changes

- Updated dependencies [f9b6156]
  - @neta-art/cohub@8.7.0

## 6.3.0

### Minor Changes

- 6685de4: Streamline Board CLI commands:
  
  - Add `boards batch` to apply an atomic batch of semantic Board changes in one round-trip.
  - Add `boards connections` (list/get) for managing typed connections between Board items.
  - Split effect, composition, animation, and item commands into `list`/`get` subcommands with consistent JSON and table output.
  - Remove the low-level `boards nodes` command in favor of the semantic item commands.
  - Import board helpers from the public SDK.

### Patch Changes

- 3dd452b: Run CLI self-updates in a detached background worker so foreground commands are not blocked. Successful updates take effect on the next invocation.

## 6.2.0

### Minor Changes

- 6a83978: fix(cli): upload directory contents directly under --dir

  `spaces files upload <dir> --dir <target>` used to nest the source
  directory name under the target (`target/<dir>/...`). It now contributes
  the directory's contents directly (`target/...`), matching common cloud
  CLIs (`aws s3 cp dir`, `rclone copy`).
  File arguments are unchanged. Inputs whose contents collide on the same
  relative path now fail fast instead of silently overwriting.

## 6.1.4

### Patch Changes

- 38b9451: Apps publish: explain Space-path targets instead of failing with a bare 404.

  - `apps publish` / `apps update` now preflight `--file` / `--dir` targets against the target Space's workspace and fail before publishing with an explicit message, e.g. `"dist" does not exist in the Space workspace (--dir takes a Space workspace path, not a local path).`
  - When the publish worker still rejects a target (e.g. removed between check and snapshot), the bare worker error is translated to the same explicit wording.
  - Help text and docs now state that `--file` / `--dir` take Space workspace paths, not local paths.

## 6.1.0

### Minor Changes

- 9bec315: Rework app permission grants around per-space authorization.

  - Viewer grants are now per Space (`app_viewer_grants` keyed by app + viewer + space): an app can be granted different scopes on its home Space and on any Space the viewer picks. `cohub.auth.request()` accepts `spaceId`, and the consent dialog shows the target Space name resolved by Cohub.
  - `cohub.auth.requestSpace()` merges space selection and the grant into one consent dialog: the host loads the viewer's space list (the app only learns the picked Space), the result carries the picked Space, and returning viewers are re-authorized silently against their last pick.
  - `auth.request` / `auth.requestSpace` accept `alwaysAsk` to skip silent reuse and force a fresh consent dialog (re-confirming or switching Spaces). `cohub.context().permissions.viewerGrants` now includes previously granted scopes so apps can render state without triggering a dialog; apps never manage grant caches themselves.
  - Either grant source is enough: a bounded publisher `appScopes` set (`space.view`, `session.view`, `file.view`, `file.edit`, `taskrun.view`, `session.prompt.readonly`, `session.prompt.fullaccess`, `command.execute`, home Space only) or a viewer grant (any supported permission on any Space). App creation, configuration, publishing, and deletion accept only real account principals, so an App cannot edit its own grants or lifecycle. Publisher scopes and App status resolve live from the DB once per request, so disabling an App or removing `file.edit`/Prompt access takes effect immediately. Viewer grants are also validated at grant time and re-validated on every request against the viewer's own current access.
  - `allowedViewerScopes` is no longer enforced — viewers may grant any permission they hold themselves. The field stays on the wire for compatibility.
  - Grant TTL is now 14 days (matching the consent dialog copy); tokens stay at 1 hour. Tokens carry identity, the eight bounded publisher scopes, and a display-only snapshot of the consented scopes (`viewerScopes`, kept for legacy JWT-inspecting clients) — effective publisher and viewer permissions resolve from the DB per request rather than trusting claims. App session minting and verification also clamp publisher scopes, so legacy rows and already-issued tokens cannot retain unsupported direct permissions.
  - Revocation is durable: silent re-authorization (`silent: true` on the authorize endpoint, set automatically by the host when reusing a cached consent or auto-authorizing the publisher) only renews a live grant that still covers the requested scopes — it never creates, widens, or revives one. Silent responses return the full stored grant scopes rather than the narrower refresh request, keeping the API, JWT display snapshot, host cache, and DB aligned. The publisher's auto-authorization still works for their own app (implicit consent when no revoked row exists) but no longer bypasses revoke, and `alwaysAsk` now forces the dialog for owners too. Explicit consent replaces the stored scope set, the host cache mirrors that exactly instead of union-merging, and a denied dialog never discards an already-valid token. App session minting, authorization, and grant management accept only real account principals, so delegated tokens cannot mint grants or exchange themselves for another App's identity. Authorize requests targeting a caller-supplied Space verify that it exists.
  - The authorize upsert is index-agnostic (works under both the legacy two-column and the new three-column unique index), so the new code can deploy before the `0064` migration; multi-space grants activate once the migration lands. Deploy code first — the old code's two-column ON CONFLICT cannot run after the migration.
  - New APIs: `GET /api/apps/:id/grants` (list your own grants) and `DELETE /api/apps/:id/grants/:grantId` (revoke). SDK: `apps.listMyGrants`, `apps.revokeMyGrant`. CLI: `cohub apps authorize`, `cohub apps grants`, `cohub apps revoke`.
  - Delegated app authorization in scheduled tasks is a reference, not a snapshot: the worker resolves the app's live publisher scopes plus the viewer's live grant (intersected with current access) from server state before any side effect, so an editable cron payload can never widen scopes — forged snapshots are ignored, and an expired/revoked/downgraded authorization aborts the task (`UnrecoverableError`) instead of spending the viewer's quota. A published app is the master switch for the whole delegation: disabling it stops queued tasks immediately instead of letting a lingering viewer grant drive them for up to 14 days, while publisher scopes stay bound to the app's home space — cross-space tasks keep running on the viewer's grant for that space. App sessions may only manage their own cron jobs and cannot edit task payloads at all (creation stays gated by the prompt permission), and `payload.auth` is server-generated provenance for every caller: cron updates strip any client-supplied auth and preserve the original verbatim, so no account can inject or swap an app authorization reference to borrow a published app's publisher scopes.
  - Prompt auth intersects viewer grant scopes with the viewer's current permissions on the space at submission time, so a role downgrade strips lost scopes (e.g. `member.manage`) instead of trusting the consent-time snapshot. Scheduled tasks re-validate via the shared `resolveViewerGrantScopesAtUseTime` (bound to the grant's full identity: id + app + viewer + space) before any side effect: an expired token, a dead grant, a lost prompt permission, or an auth context that does not match the task aborts it (`UnrecoverableError`) instead of letting it run unauthenticated and spend the viewer's quota. The reported `viewerScopes` are always the trimmed set.
  - Silent grant coverage honours permission implications everywhere (`session.prompt.fullaccess` covers `session.prompt.readonly`, `file.view` covers `file.view.filtered`): the server renews such requests silently instead of returning 403, and the SDK cache reuses them without re-prompting.
  - Both SDK layers key remembered consents by the canonical Space id and scopes returned by the authorize endpoint, so implicit and explicit home-space grants converge onto one entry instead of double-counting. The host migrates legacy keys without renewing or overwriting newer consent state; only definitive 401/403/404 authorization failures clear cache and reopen consent, while network errors, 429, and 5xx preserve it and return a retryable error.
  - New account-level scope `user.taskrun.list`: with an explicit viewer grant, an app can list and read every Task Run owned by the viewer through the unscoped task list, including runs from Spaces they can no longer access and account-level runs. It grants no access to the source Spaces or to other users' runs. Without it, app sessions keep the strictly space-scoped view.
  - `taskrun.view` viewer grants are strictly space-scoped: without `user.taskrun.list`, the unscoped Task Run list filters rows to spaces with a live grant that still matches the viewer's current access (previously any single grant exposed the viewer's runs across every space), and account-level runs stay hidden.
  - Grant-time scope validation resolves the viewer's permission set once per authorize instead of one membership/policy query per requested scope, and uses the shared implication-aware permission check so stronger access can grant a weaker scope such as `file.view.filtered`.
  - Batched space-permission filtering for app sessions: one grant load plus one membership batch instead of a query per space. The account-level Task Run list is a direct owner-filtered paginated query, with no pre-scan over run history or Space memberships. The Web and CLI publisher controls expose the same eight bounded direct scopes; broader capabilities remain available through viewer consent.

### Patch Changes

- Updated dependencies [7e0f977]
  - @neta-art/cohub@8.0.1

## 6.0.0

### Major Changes

- 5c0c0b2: Rename the Work commands to App/Desktop vocabulary in the CLI.

  **Breaking changes**

  - `cohub apps` is the canonical command for managing published Apps (replacing `cohub works`).
  - `cohub desktop open` is the canonical command for opening a surface/tab (replacing `cohub ui preview`).

  **Compatibility**

  - `cohub works` and `cohub ui preview` remain as deprecated aliases, so existing scripts and muscle-memory keep working until the next breaking release.
  - The CLI now reads and writes the canonical App wire vocabulary end to end.

## 5.0.0

### Major Changes

- 24c7201: Board semantic authoring protocol

  **Breaking changes**

  - Semantic mutations (`POST /boards/:id/mutations`) now accept `board.patch`, `connection.*`, `effect.*`, and `composition.*` commands alongside `item.*`; all commands compile into one atomic transaction.
  - `POST /boards/:id/validate`, SDK `board.validate()`, CLI `cohub boards validate`/`apply` removed. Use semantic mutations with `dryRun: true` for server-side validation.
  - SDK `boards.create()` and `board.authoring()` return the semantic `BoardAuthoringSnapshot` (items, connections, effects, compositions, playback); raw Board bootstrap/transaction methods were removed.
  - `BoardSummary.counts.nodes` renamed to `counts.items`; `BoardCapabilities` exposes `items` instead of `nodes`.
  - SDK realtime board event and subscription handler are now `board.changed` / `changed`, with semantic `changed` projection and no wire operations.
  - CLI: `boards nodes add/patch/remove` replaced by `boards items create/patch/replace/delete`; `boards examples` and `boards capabilities` provide templates and schemas.

  **New**

  - `dryRun: true` on semantic mutations: full server-side validation (version, references, cascade) without writing or consuming the mutation id.
  - Idempotent mutation replay via persisted receipts; no-op mutations record a `validated` receipt without bumping the board version.
  - Composition re-apply is row-diffed: unchanged tracks/clips keep their rows, identical aggregates short-circuit to a no-op.
  - Targeted reads for item, connection, effect and composition projections; section-scoped validation reads for mutations.
  - `BoardEffectSchema` lives in one module (`board-effect.js`) shared by create and mutation paths.
  - Web, CLI and SDK all use the same public `authoring()` / `mutateSemantic()` / `board.changed` path; pending Web edits persist semantic mutations.
  - `item.reorder` expresses z-order without exposing storage `orderKey`; `effect.apply` is the idempotent declaration-style effect command.
  - Mutation receipts expose `outcome: applied | noop | dry-run`; Board realtime uses the same semantic changed projection.
  - Checkpoints and published Works store the same semantic Item snapshot as live authoring reads; legacy Sequence/Node snapshot compatibility was removed.

## 3.8.0

### Minor Changes

- 6d68beb: Add Work previews in the workspace and let an Agent drive them.

  Works become a fourth preview domain alongside files, Boards, and ports, so a
  published Work can run as a workspace tab (`?preview=work:<workId>`). The Work
  detail page gains a **Preview** action beside **New tab**.

  `cohub ui preview <work>` shows that preview in the Cohub tab the current chat
  started from, and `--call <method>` invokes a method the Work registered with
  `client.work.surface.handle()`. Showing is idempotent, so a repeat re-activates the
  same tab. Retrying with the same command id re-delivers it, which recovers a
  dispatch that never reached the browser; delivery is at-least-once, so callable
  methods should be safe to repeat.

  Routing uses a new `RequestSource.clientId`, propagated from the browser through
  prompts, agent turns, and the Sandbox (`COHUB_SOURCE_CLIENT_ID`). Commands reach
  only the acting user's own frontend instance, and a Work exposes nothing beyond the
  methods it registers.

  A Work can also attach one custom context chip to the Cohub composer with
  `client.work.composer.setChip()`. The compact label opens a lightweight full-text
  preview, while the original content is preserved in the sent message for the
  Agent and timeline.

  A Work answers surface calls and sends composer context only to an explicit list
  of Cohub app origins (or its own), never a `*.cohub.run` suffix match, so neither
  a third-party embedder nor a Work served from a Cohub content subdomain can invoke
  another Work's methods or alter the Cohub composer. Surface calls acknowledge
  delivery; the Work reports the final UI command result directly with the SDK.

## 3.1.1

### Patch Changes

- 54cd4d0: Move the Board document model, renderers, and image exporters into the Cohub SDK, organised by dependency so each entry only carries what it needs:

  - `@neta-art/cohub/board` — document schema, geometry, shapes, timeline compilation, and export planning. No PixiJS, so it runs on servers, agents, and edge workers.
  - `@neta-art/cohub/board/render` — the PixiJS card renderers, themes, and palette the editor draws with.
  - `@neta-art/cohub/board/export` — rendering a planned export to a canvas in the browser.
  - `@neta-art/cohub/board/headless` — Node.js image export on `@napi-rs/canvas`.

  `pixi.js` and `@napi-rs/canvas` stay optional peers, needed only for the rendering and export entries. Board modules also keep their build boundaries, so consumers tree-shake unused schemas and renderers instead of pulling in the whole model.

- Updated dependencies [54cd4d0]
  - @neta-art/cohub@3.2.0

## 3.1.0

### Minor Changes

- 7140fbe: Add board image export, shared between the web editor and the CLI.

  The board renderers, geometry and codec now live in a new `@neta-art/cohub-board`
  package, so the same PixiJS card renderers draw a board on screen and in a
  headless Node export. `cohub boards export <board> -o out.png` renders a board id
  or `.board` path, with `--frame`, `--items` and `--rect` regions, `--scale`,
  `--theme`, `--background transparent` and PNG/JPEG/WebP output. In the editor,
  Shift+Cmd/Ctrl+E (or the context menu) opens an export dialog that can download
  or copy the image, reusing the live renderer and the current theme.

  Two rendering fixes came out of this: non-Latin text (CJK) rendered as
  missing-glyph boxes because the renderers asked for a Latin-only font with no
  fallback, and shape label colors in the hard-coded fallback palette had drifted
  from the CSS tokens, making note text dark-on-dark wherever the CSS was not
  available.

### Major Changes

- 760a6ec: Align the CLI with the Board domain rename in `@neta-art/cohub` 3.0.0. The CLI now targets the Board transaction and playback APIs; canvas-era SDK surfaces it depended on are gone.

### Minor Changes

The level is fully optional — omitted values inherit the session default, matching existing provider/model behavior. UI, CLI, and SDK all support per-model thinking level selection driven by models config (`reasoning`, `defaultThinkingLevel`, `thinkingLevelMap`). Effective thinking level is persisted to turn meta and exposed on turn records for multi-client recovery.

- dad311e: Recover WebSocket sessions from a transient authentication failure by forcing one access-token refresh, reconnecting once, and restoring room subscriptions without entering an infinite retry loop.
- Updated dependencies [dad311e]
  - @neta-art/cohub@2.14.1

## 2.6.0

### Minor Changes

- f72fa82: Expose structured canvas transaction conflicts and richer published Work metadata through the Cohub SDK and CLI dependency bundle.

  - Export `CanvasTransactionError` with status, code, and `isVersionConflict` so clients can rebase and retry rejected canvas transactions.
  - Add `lang` and `themeColor` to published Work metadata types.

### Patch Changes

- Updated dependencies [f72fa82]
  - @neta-art/cohub@2.14.0

## 2.5.1

### Patch Changes

- Upgrade `@neta-art/generation` dependency to `^0.1.16`.

## 2.5.0

### Minor Changes

- Carry request provenance via `X-Cohub-Source-*` headers for cross-space traceability.

  - **SDK**: `requestSource` on client options (static or per-request getter); transport stamps `X-Cohub-Source-*` automatically; re-export provenance helpers (`readRequestSourceFromEnv`, `requestSourceToHeaders`, `mergeRequestSourceIntoMeta`, …).
  - **CLI**: every request sends `via: cli` and sandbox `COHUB_*` identity when present; drop ad-hoc `meta.source` / `versionMeta` / `meta.cohub` merge on works and generations.
  - **Breaking note**: `WorkCreateInput.versionMeta` removed — publish provenance is taken from request headers instead.

### Patch Changes

- Updated dependencies
  - @neta-art/cohub@2.13.0

## 2.4.0

### Minor Changes

- d21c200: Ship the resource-references graph-edge model and empty-account Home space bootstrap that the API and agent already expose.

  - **feat(references): graph-edge model with agent file access stats** — turn-level sources, file targets, and agent tool file kinds (`agent_tool_file_read|write|edit|ls|find|grep`); drop redundant `participant` edges; `ReferenceRecord` uses `sourceSpaceId` / `sourceSessionId`; aggregate supports `groupBy=target` and `limit`.
  - **feat: auto-create Home space for empty accounts** — `spaces.getDefault()` creates a blank Home space (`slug=home`) when the account has no accessible space.
  - **CLI**: `references query` accepts `turn:<uuid>`; aggregate `--group-by target` / `--limit`; file targets render as short space id + path.

### Patch Changes

- Updated dependencies [d21c200]
  - @neta-art/cohub@2.12.0

## 2.3.3

### Patch Changes

- 1d27866: Stop silent SSO login callback redirect loops by letting bootstrap `getMe` skip the unauthorized handler, and ship Apache-2.0 LICENSE/NOTICE with the published packages.
- Updated dependencies [1d27866]
  - @neta-art/cohub@2.11.2

## 2.3.2

### Patch Changes

- 43b7653: Record optional provenance on work versions via `meta` (CLI auto-fills `source` from COHUB\_\* env).
- Updated dependencies [43b7653]
  - @neta-art/cohub@2.11.1

## 2.3.1

### Patch Changes

- 6c0b75f: Add durable chat attachments that no longer require a session.

  SDK: `publicAssets.uploadChatAttachment()` for any file mime, optional `spaceId`/`sessionId` association only, and space upload `downloadUrl` materialize (skip client PUT when the file is already a durable public asset). `sandbox_tmp` destination `sessionId` is optional; plan entries may omit `uploadUrl`/`objectKey` for remote sources.

  CLI: `spaces prompt --image` works without `--session`; file upload complete skips remote `downloadUrl` entries that the server pulls itself.

- 86e11a7: Expose generation model discount billing details in SDK results and CLI output.
- Updated dependencies [6c0b75f]
- Updated dependencies [86e11a7]
  - @neta-art/cohub@2.11.0

## 2.3.0

### Minor Changes

### Patch Changes

- Updated dependencies [a45d3e8]
  - @neta-art/cohub@2.10.0

## 2.2.10

### Patch Changes

- 74a3b9d: Add raw space LLM completions that skip the agent turn queue. Callers fully control message history and an optional space-relative system prompt file.

  SDK: `space.completion()` (JSON) and `space.streamCompletion()` (SSE deltas with abort-safe streaming).
  CLI: `cohub completion` / `cohub spaces completion` with `--stream`, `--system-prompt`, model/provider, temperature, max tokens, and thinking level.

- Updated dependencies [74a3b9d]
  - @neta-art/cohub@2.9.0

## 2.2.9

### Patch Changes

- 10989f6: Record multimodal generation usage against the shared credit balance after successful provider calls. Add `generation.music` usage type, resolve image/video/music kinds for billing gates, and surface post-success `billing` metadata on generation task results.

  Also add hourly generation usage stats (mirroring LLM token rollups) so multimodal usage appears in trending and usage endpoints.

- 9188401: Unify billing gate responses. Every billing-gated 402 (negative balance limit and plan entitlement) now returns a flat `{ code, message, billing: { conversion, status?, netUsd?, hardNegativeLimitUsd? } }` body, and soft debt warnings ride the same `billing` payload on success responses. The SDK adds `BILLING_ACCESS_BLOCKED_ERROR_CODE`, `isBillingAccessBlockedError`, `isBillingAccessBlockedCode`, `extractBillingPayload`, and a `BillingResponsePayload` type so clients extract the conversion intent with one call. Websocket `session.request.error` events now carry the same `billing` payload. The CLI surfaces the conversion title/message on 402.

### Patch Changes

- e854b0e: Bump the pinned `sandboxd` binary version to v1.82.4, which includes the local
  sandbox `/workspace` path mapping fix.

## 2.2.2

### Patch Changes

- ce4fc3c: Bump the pinned `sandboxd` binary version to v1.82.2. This is the first
  release whose archives were actually published to the public CDN — the
  `publish-cdn` job had been failing on every tag since the managed-download
  workflow landed, so the previous pin (v1.80.2) 404'd on download. With this
  bump, `sandbox up` resolves a version that exists on the CDN.
- Updated dependencies [ace4b41]
  - @neta-art/cohub@2.3.0

### Patch Changes

- 7907e1d: Show buyer profiles on commerce orders and enforce the minimum product price.
- Updated dependencies [7907e1d]
  - @neta-art/cohub@2.2.1

## 2.2.0

### Minor Changes

- 2a29102: Add credit benefits and consumption to work commerce, closing the monetization loop.

  - Add virtual `cohub_credit` token type and `work.consumption` usage type to billing declarations. Credit amounts are plain integers at business scope — creators never see token types.
  - Add `createBusinessBillingOperations` / `createDisabledBusinessBillingOperations` for business-scoped entitlement lookups, credit status, and credit consumption. Shares the same credit mapping helpers as platform billing so the two never drift.
  - Space commerce now supports `credits` benefit type (amount + optional expiry). Token type, scope, and grant kind are fixed and hidden from creators.
  - Product serialization fills `display.creditBenefits` from bound credit benefits so Works can show "includes 500 credits".
  - Work commerce replaces `POST entitlements/check` with `GET entitlements` — one call returns feature entitlements and credit balance. Adds `POST credits/consume` with idempotent `operationId`.
  - SDK `cohub.work.commerce` gains `getEntitlements()` and `consumeCredits()`, replacing `checkEntitlements()`.
  - CLI `works commerce` gains `entitlements` and `credits consume` commands; `spaces commerce benefits create` gains `--type credits --amount`.
  - Web benefit editor supports both feature and credits types.

### Patch Changes

  CLI breaking changes: remove draft status flags and `cohub works update --publish-version`, replace version publication with `cohub works publish-version`, add work visibility controls, and support role-qualified generation media inputs.
