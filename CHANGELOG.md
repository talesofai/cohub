# Changelog

All notable changes to Cohub are documented in this file.

<!-- Generated from apps/web/src/lib/changelog/entries.json. Do not edit. -->

## v2.15 — 2026-08-09

- **Work preview tabs**: Published Works can now open as first-class, deep-linkable tabs beside the Space detail view, with public-content fallback, launch-state preservation, retry states, and shared preview-budget management.
- **Agent-driven UI commands**: Added `cohub ui preview` and the SDK's `client.ui` surface to open a Work in the originating Cohub tab and invoke registered methods, with provenance routing, atomic Redis-backed command persistence, idempotent command IDs, detached execution, and waits up to 12 hours.
- **Secure Work Surface RPC**: Introduced a typed, explicit-origin `postMessage` protocol for `client.work.surface.handle()` methods; calls acknowledge delivery first and complete asynchronously through `client.ui.reportResult()`, without DOM access or script evaluation.
- **Composer context chips**: Works can attach, update, and clear compact plain-text context in the Cohub composer, keeping full selection details available to the user and the Agent while the Work is active.

### Bug Fixes

- **Work preview scrolling**: Prevented workspace drawer gestures from intercepting scroll input inside Work previews.
- **Preview chrome**: Removed the duplicate Work preview header so previews use the shared workspace chrome consistently.

## v2.14 — 2026-08-07

- **CSV table preview**: `.csv` and `text/csv` files now render as tables in the file preview with a sticky header, capped row truncation, and empty-cell handling, backed by a new dependency-free parser with delimiter auto-detection, quoted-field and CRLF support
- **Creator view analytics**: published Works now record views per version, hour, and source (Web, CLI, API) into an hourly rollup, exposed via `GET /api/works/:id/stats` and a new `works.getStats()` SDK method, with a Work detail panel showing total, 24h/7d windows, a 30-day trend, and source breakdown for space editors
- **Redis-buffered view stats**: view recording is buffered in Redis and flushed in batches by a lock-protected system-worker job with atomic batch cuts and batched upserts, so counting views never blocks Work access and DB writes are amortized
- **Structured auth failure logging**: access-token verification failures are logged with machine-readable reason codes (expired, signature, JWKS, claims), making auth debugging faster
- **Work analytics CLI**: `cohub works stats` reports total, 24-hour, 7-day, and 30-day view counts with a per-source breakdown, resolving Works by ID, public URL, mention URI, or username/space/work slug.

### Bug Fixes

- **Stale preview save conflict recovery**: when a file save hits a 409 that turns out to be stale, the preview now re-fetches the fresh file and auto-recovers — or confirms the save already landed — instead of surfacing a false 'Changed elsewhere' error

## v2.13 — 2026-08-07

- **Coordinated token refresh**: Access-token resolution is now single-flighted across concurrent requests and same-origin tabs — a Web Locks-backed coordinator with a shared session snapshot ensures a 401 storm triggers exactly one refresh exchange, waiters reuse the winning token, and duplicate sign-in redirects are deduplicated.
- **Stale-session guards in the SDK**: HttpTransport now stamps 401s with the auth session version, passes an UnauthorizedContext with matchesRejectedToken to onUnauthorized, and adds the getAuthSessionVersion client option plus a matchesUnauthorizedErrorToken export — letting clients prove a rejection is stale and preserve a newer session instead of signing out.
- **More readable space danmaku**: Danmaku text and lane spacing are enlarged on desktop and mobile for clearer legibility of space activity.
- **Simplified CLI Work downloads**: Work download results drop redundant content-verification status fields, reporting only the output path, file count, and bytes.

### Bug Fixes

- Concurrent 401s could trigger parallel token refresh exchanges and multiple OAuth redirects, causing sign-in loops — now collapsed into a single refresh and redirect.
- An outdated 401 could clear a session that had already been refreshed, logging users out mid-session — stale rejections are now ignored via session-generation guards.

## v2.12 — 2026-08-07

- **Space creation alignment**: `cohub spaces create` now supports `--checkpoint` bootstrap, the SDK exposes typed bootstrap lifecycle metadata (`SpaceBootstrapMeta`) and requires a space `name`, and bootstrap sources are validated and sanitized end-to-end — Git credentials are stripped from repo URLs, bootstrap metadata, and task-run responses.
- **Work launch parameters**: query-string and hash parameters on a Work URL are now forwarded to the embedded Work (reserved `cohub_*` params excluded), so deep links can drive state inside published Works.
- **Embedded Work capabilities**: interactive Work frames now delegate low-risk, user-activated browser capabilities — pointer lock, clipboard write, fullscreen, and web share — so embedded Works behave like first-class web apps.
- **Execution-scoped environment**: the agent now loads one immutable space-environment snapshot per execution instead of caching it at session load and sandbox attach, so env changes apply immediately and stale values never leak across runs.
- **Explore removal**: the Explore feature is removed across the web app, API, SDK, and infra config — including the `client.explore` API and its types — reflected in the SDK v5 major version bump.

### Bug Fixes

- Fixed false file preview edit conflicts by comparing file versions at the integer-millisecond precision shared by all filesystem transports, so Node fractional mtimes no longer mismatch Go sandbox protocol values.
- Fixed the CLI `tasks ls` command ignoring the global `--space` option.
- Fixed voice input not closing when a message is sent, and guarded the composer against stale voice-client callbacks.
- The CLI local sandbox now names the created space from the folder basename when no name is provided.

## v2.11 — 2026-08-06

- **Realtime rooms**: Works can now create or join code-scoped rooms through `client.work.realtime` and exchange generic JSON events over the existing Gateway WebSocket — with member presence, room-scoped sequencing, publish ACKs, and short-lived admission tickets — so a published Work can run multiplayer state with no backend of its own.
- **High-frequency sends**: `room.send()` omits the per-event acknowledgment round trip that caps `publish` at ~1000/RTT events per second, making it suitable for input frames and other high-rate traffic; failures surface via `room.onSendError()` instead of rejected promises.
- **Per-viewer seats**: rooms created with `seatPerUser` give each viewer at most one seat — a second tab or a rejoin after an unclean disconnect takes over the existing seat — while members carry an opaque `userKey` so applications can group a viewer's connections without seeing the account id.
- **Redis-only room infrastructure**: rooms are backed by renewable membership leases, a bounded serialized mutation queue, room-wide publish and per-connection presence rate limits, 16 KB payload caps, and an absolute 24-hour lifetime that activity never extends; each Work is limited to 512 active rooms with quota enforced at creation (HTTP 429 `ROOM_QUOTA_EXCEEDED`).

### Bug Fixes

- Fixed a join race where a member joining between the snapshot read and the local subscription was delivered to neither; the subscription is now established before the snapshot is taken.
- Fixed an event leak where a connection holding a valid ticket for a full room could briefly enter the routing table and receive room events during the capacity check.
- Restored the client-side sequence filter so pub/sub can no longer replay an event already reflected in the snapshot, which could re-run custom events or revert presence to a stale value.
- Unified membership teardown in the Gateway so a swept or superseded connection stops receiving room events and is closed with reason `superseded` instead of lingering in the member list.

## v2.10 — 2026-08-05

- **Cohub Balance**: platform-managed prepaid balance for Space commerce products — a whole-dollar `cohubBalanceUsd` provisions a Billing product plus a global USD credit benefit, buyers receive the full balance on purchase, and the amount is configurable end-to-end via the API, SDK, CLI (`--cohub-balance-usd`), and web product editor
- **Purchase idempotency**: Work commerce purchases now carry a stable `purchaseAttemptId` (or `Idempotency-Key` header) that maps to a Billing order idempotency key, so client retries after timeouts resolve to the original order instead of creating duplicates
- **Resolve fan-out hardening**: the public work-commerce product resolve endpoint now fans out to Billing with a bounded concurrency pool (max 4) and caps on product key count and length, and bound benefit keys are read from authoritative Billing bindings instead of product meta — bounding upstream load and eliminating stale benefit attribution
- **New Chat background accessibility**: HTML new-chat backgrounds are live documents with focusable controls, so only image/video backgrounds are treated as decorative (`aria-hidden`); HTML backgrounds stay in the accessibility tree, with regression tests added to the protocol package

### Bug Fixes

- HTML new-chat backgrounds are no longer hidden from assistive technology while their controls remained keyboard-focusable (WCAG 4.1.2)
- Bound benefit keys are resolved from Billing bindings instead of product meta, fixing stale benefit attribution in commerce resolve and serialize paths
- Cohub Balance products are provisioned active-and-private instead of draft — Billing refuses binding a benefit to a draft product — with compensation rollback when provisioning fails

## v2.9 — 2026-08-04

- **Sandbox filesystem mutations**: File writes, directory creation, deletes, and moves in cloud spaces are now executed inside the sandbox by the agent over its existing connection pool, so sandbox-local watchers observe every change and the direct PVC write path is only used when no sandbox is dialable
- **Idempotent file mutations**: All filesystem operations and board creation accept a mutationId that maps to a stable, space-scoped BullMQ job id (canonical payload hashing included), so client retries reuse the same job instead of re-applying a mutation; board create derives deterministic board/transaction ids and safely reuses or cleans up orphaned manifests on retry
- **Interactive mutation queue**: A new sandbox_fs_mutation job type with a 30-second interactive timeout and fail-fast errors, best-effort cancellation of queued jobs on timeout, and automatic redaction of file content from Redis once a job settles
- **Save reliability in the web editor**: Autosave retries reuse the persisted mutationId so a save interrupted by reload dedupes on the backend instead of issuing a second mutation, and sandbox-inotify echoes during an in-flight save are no longer misread as external edits

### Bug Fixes

- Inline write limits hardened: base64 payloads could bypass the decoded-size cap with whitespace padding and reach Redis — both raw and decoded sizes are now bounded with a 413 response
- mutationId validation (length and format) is now enforced on dir, delete, and move routes, not just file writes

## v2.8 — 2026-08-03

- **Image-to-text fallback**: images sent to text-only models are now transparently described by a configured vision model, with descriptions persisted per turn (JSONL sidecar plus DB) so they are reused instead of re-billed, and per-call provider/model/usage/cost recorded on the turn. Configuration lives in a shared `config-runtime/image-to-text` module with Redis-cached platform and per-user overrides, wired through API completions, the agent runtime, and the message postprocess worker.
- **Upload transfer progress**: file uploads report real byte-level progress across the composer, space file pane, and profile/space settings, with an accessible indeterminate-to-determinate progress bar and cancellation via `AbortSignal`. The SDK gained `onProgress` and `signal` on public asset and chat attachment uploads, switching to XHR to expose upload events.
- **Runtime reliability hardening**: agent session JSONL files now recover from truncated trailing entries and missing final newlines by archiving the partial file and fsyncing the repair before reopening; sandbox uploads verify transferred size and surface a typed mismatch error; prompt submission validates the requested provider/model against platform and user model configs; the QQ gateway classifies 4xx config failures to back off for five minutes instead of hot-looping, adds handshake timeouts and tracing spans, and the Go relay client applies the same retry classification.
- **LLM image plumbing refactor**: remote-image URL marshaling moved out of `stream-completion.ts` into a dedicated `llm/image-content` module shared by the completion and image-to-text paths, and model-config loading was factored into reusable `config-runtime/models` helpers consumed by API, worker, and agent.

### Bug Fixes

- Image-to-text config cache now refreshes when a checkpoint publishes new config, so model changes take effect without waiting for TTL expiry.
- Agent context projection no longer deep-clones the whole context, preserving tool function references and leaving the original context unmutated.
- Upload progress is scoped per attachment instead of shared across a batch, so concurrent uploads no longer overwrite each other's state.
- Danmaku speed, lane spacing, and visible-item caps retuned for smoother density under bursts.

## v2.7 — 2026-08-03

- **Friendly space invitations**: invite links now resolve through `/username/space-slug/join/<token>` with a shared invite page, plus Redis Lua-backed atomic usage reservation, per-space invite caps, and revocation — exposed end-to-end through the SDK and new `cohub spaces invites create/ls/revoke` commands
- **Filesystem cache reconciliation rewrite**: the web space-fs repository moved to IndexedDB v14 with a dedicated epoch store, a transactional `idbRunTransaction` helper, sequence-gap detection that escalates to full resync, and a refresh coordinator that merges pending batches per lane so concurrent change events no longer thrash the cache or the UI
- **Mod resources served from checkpoint snapshots**: agent now loads mod skills, rules, and append-system prompts from the `latest` checkpoint cache instead of the live workspace, so mounted mods and sandboxes always agree on one immutable snapshot; deploy manifests mount `CHECKPOINT_CACHE_ROOT` read-only
- **Preview navigation state machine**: workspace file preview extracted into a standalone transition-id based navigation module, replacing the ad-hoc clip transition and eliminating stale renders when route, user, and restore sources race
- Project skills load directly from the live workspace, dropping the revision-keyed Redis cache layer for immediate freshness after edits

### Bug Fixes

- Abort signals and other non-plain objects are preserved in completion payloads — image URL restoration no longer walks class instances and strips them
- Preview panel open and close transitions are now reliable instead of intermittently dropping frames or getting stuck

## v2.6 — 2026-07-31

- **Space turn browsing**: a new permission-aware `GET /api/spaces/:id/turns` endpoint lists turns across all visible Sessions with author, session, and time-boundary filters plus stable cursor pagination, exposed through protocol types, the SDK (`SpaceTurnsApi`), and a new `cohub spaces turns ls` command with table and JSON output. The web workspace replays recent turns from other members through the existing danmaku layer, using local cursors, cross-tab lease coordination, deduplication, and live-message priority so catch-up never crowds out real-time activity.
- **1 GiB Work publishes**: file, HTML, Board, and directory Works now accept up to 1 GiB, up from 5 MB for assets and 100 MB for sites. The publish job was rewritten to stream from disk through S3 multipart uploads (`@aws-sdk/lib-storage`) instead of buffering whole files and directories in memory, with HTML metadata parsing bounded to a 5 MB prefix read.
- **500 MB gateway attachments**: inbound and outbound media limits are consolidated behind a shared `GATEWAY_ATTACHMENT_MAX_BYTES` constant and raised to 500 MB. A new `temp-media-file` module streams responses and base64 payloads to mode-`0600` temp files with byte-limit transforms and stream timeouts, replacing the buffer-everything path in the WeChat and Feishu providers.
- **Indexed turn queries**: message lookups across the agent, API snapshot, and turn finalization paths now filter on the indexed `turn_id` column instead of the unindexed `meta->>'turnId'` JSONB expression, removing sequential scans over the full messages table on large deployments.
- **Model in tool environment**: sandbox commands receive `COHUB_MODEL_PROVIDER` and `COHUB_MODEL_ID`, so tools and scripts can adapt to the model driving the current turn.

### Bug Fixes

- Raised the Work publish asset job wait timeout from 15 to 30 minutes so large publishes are no longer cut short.

## v2.5 — 2026-07-31

- **Recoverable context compaction**: compaction now runs at any LLM round boundary instead of only between turns, records structured metadata (scope, owner turn, trigger reason, token deltas, usage, duration), and rolls the session back to its pre-compaction archive when summarization fails, so a bad compaction no longer poisons the running turn. The web client renders it as an inline notice with expandable summary, token savings, and cost, streamed live through the SDK.
- **Indexed turn IDs on messages**: session messages persist a dedicated `turn_id` column with a partial `(turn_id, sequence)` index, replacing JSON metadata lookups for turn-scoped reads, with a backfill script that keeps legacy `meta.turnId` rows readable during migration.
- **Mod skill provenance**: skills mounted from mods carry a structured source (mod space and mount slug) through the config runtime, API, SDK, and CLI, so the slash command menu and `cohub skills` show which mod a skill comes from rather than a bare scope.
- **Shared public identifier rules**: username and Space slug validation moved into a single `@cohub/protocol/public-identifiers` module with one reserved platform path list, so server and web enforce identical rules and new identities can no longer shadow platform routes. Existing stored values stay readable.

### Bug Fixes

- Compaction stats no longer inflate provider call counts when a summarization retry succeeds, and the turn ordinal shows the compaction's position within its turn instead of the global message sequence.
- Model status heartbeats are resampled into a fixed 96-bucket window, so the hover chart stays legible regardless of upstream sample density.
- Feishu bot identity is read from the correct response shape, restoring bot open_id resolution and channel readiness.

## v2.4 — 2026-07-29

- **Agent-actionable board viewport context**: chat viewport context now carries the viewed board's `boardId` instead of raw camera coordinates, so the agent can inspect and render the exact board a user is looking at, while `visibleRect` and selected nodes still convey focus. `ViewportCamera` is removed from the protocol and from the `BoardViewState`/`BoardRuntimeViewState` report contract.
- **Trusted identity resolution for user profiles**: profile provisioning resolves a Logto identity only from a verified token subject or a previously verified binding, returning a transient profile otherwise. Usernames are never minted or promoted under a guessed binding, and cached handles are only reused when they belong to the same verified identity.
- **Owner profiles ensured at resource boundaries**: every owned-space path, including Home ensure, now goes through `createOwnedSpace`, which establishes the owner's durable profile before the Space row is inserted; principals without a sign-in get an explicit 403 instead of a half-provisioned space.

### Bug Fixes

- Cross-origin board covers now recover through an anonymous image-element loader when Pixi's worker/ImageBitmap path rejects them, keeping the fast path intact and surfacing the underlying error in retry logs.
- Fallback board textures are disposed alongside the Pixi cache entry on unload, closing a GPU texture leak and the reload race for the same URL.
- Work public identity resolves the space owner's username for any owner, not only when the acting user happens to be that owner.

## v2.3 — 2026-07-28

- **Board playback policy**: Boards can persist an autoplay policy in metadata (`sequenceId`, `delayMs`, `loop`), so opening a Board plays the right sequence with local, per-viewer timing instead of ad-hoc client wiring. Wired end-to-end through the protocol schema, API board ops, SDK, and CLI.
- **Filesystem event pipeline hardening**: The sandbox watcher closes the recursive inotify race by registering each directory before reading its children, recovers from `ErrEventOverflow` by re-walking and requesting an authoritative resync, emits deterministically ordered batches, and falls back to resync instead of allocating unbounded change lists. `fs.write` now reports create/modify disposition and the parent directories it created, and a new `fs.mkdir` RPC plus capability flags let clients update trees precisely.
- **Mobile-safe board navigation**: Touch devices default to the hand tool, with tap-to-select gated behind a pointer-type check and an 8px slop threshold, so panning a Board on a phone no longer causes accidental edits.
- **Public profile pages removed**: The `(public)/[username]` route, its loaders, and the identity affordances linking into it are gone, cutting roughly 590 lines and simplifying `UserIdentity`, presence stacks, and the explore/trending surfaces.

### Bug Fixes

- Board preview state, including animation poses and video playback, survives switching between workspace preview tabs.
- Persistent animation poses no longer drift when a Board re-mounts or replays.
- Board links sent in chat open in the board preview instead of the generic file view.
- Work publish ensures the owner has a username before publishing, avoiding broken public URLs.
- Immersive preview panel chrome and Board text editing alignment polish.

## v2.2 — 2026-07-27

- **PDF file preview**: continuous scroll viewer with header controls, plus a layout and scroll hot path that no longer scales linearly with page count on long documents
- **Board tool styles**: per-tool creation defaults (colors, sizes, stroke) now live in the protocol and SDK, shared by web, SDK and CLI, with black/white palette colors and a larger default text size
- **Figma-style rotation**: rotate selections from corner control zones, backed by shared Board geometry
- **Board moves into the SDK**: the standalone board package is gone, split into dependency-scoped entries (headless, render) so lightweight consumers no longer pull in PixiJS; note nodes removed and Markdown file-card titles now come from frontmatter
- **Live Work versions**: typed work.version.published Space realtime events, replayed onto list responses so clients stay in sync without refetching

### Bug Fixes

- Freehand Board strokes render stable rounded outlines through sharp turns and self-intersections
- Transform controls stay attached to dragged items, and boards reconcile by identity
- Board file-card covers preserve image proportions; metadata footer removed
- Themed image backdrops stay behind the transparent canvas
- Board history stays reachable on small touch screens
- Previews persist across new chat navigation

## v2.1 — 2026-07-26

- **Board image export**: renderers, geometry, palette and document codec now share the SDK Board module, so one set of PixiJS card renderers draws a board on screen and in a headless Node render. `cohub boards export <board> -o out.png` supports `--frame`/`--items`/`--rect` regions, `--scale`, `--theme`, transparent backgrounds and PNG/JPEG/WebP; in the editor Shift+Cmd/Ctrl+E opens an export dialog with live pixel-size readout, download and copy. Source textures are capped at 64 unique previews and output size budgets are now hard guarantees.
- **Board realtime awareness**: cursors, selections, creation gestures, drawing and transforms broadcast through the gateway with a protocol-level awareness schema and SDK subscriptions. Identity renders in a screen-space DOM overlay with avatars and device badges, mobile touch shows as a fading contact ring, and CLI or Agent edits surface as chip markers backed by request provenance stored on `board_transactions.metadata`; Agent markers open the originating chat.
- **Video previews on boards**: video cards decode one bounded first frame through the same asset manager as images, sharing reference counting, the LRU cooling pool and viewport-bounded loading, capped at 2 concurrent decode slots. File change events now carry path and metadata, so an overwritten video drops stale keys and adopts its real aspect ratio.
- **Theme-driven rendering**: card colors resolve from the active board theme instead of hard-coded palettes, so a space's `theme.css` applies to both canvas and exports. Node transform controls gained rotation-aware selection geometry and semantic resize capability helpers.

### Bug Fixes

- Switching board tabs kept publishing awareness for the previous board; runtime resources are now keyed on `boardId` with sequence numbers owned by a single page-level allocator
- Zoom is faster and no longer drifts under rapid or clamped input
- File-card content is clipped to node bounds with line-clamped title and excerpt
- Agent auto-compaction now counts inline base64 images against a provider-aware bound, so sessions stop stalling on repeated 413s; summarize calls also get a retry budget
- Gateway admits board awareness before queueing it
- Board tool menus are toggleable and one-shot tools return to select
- Board chrome stays visible while a board loads

## v2.0 — 2026-07-26

- **Board runtime v1**: the board domain is rebuilt around boards, nodes, effects, sequences, clips, transactions, operations, checkpoints, and playback state, replacing the document-centric canvas service with inspect/validate/apply transaction APIs plus playback commands and realtime events. Ships end-to-end: bound `BoardClient` entities with transaction and playback subscriptions in the SDK, space-scoped `boards` CLI commands for create/inspect/transaction/playback/watch, a new web animation core with Pixi-based playback, and worker checkpoints aligned to the new model. The former `canvas` domain is renamed to `board` across schema, routes, SDK, and web.
- **Any workspace file on a board**: a new `file` node accepts every file that is not natively an image or video, binaries and unknown extensions included, deriving its presentation tier from the path rather than storing display state. Snapshots are an mtime-versioned cache over the authoritative workspace file, reads are deduplicated and concurrency-capped, and availability is intentionally never persisted so one client's outage never becomes everyone's.
- **Order keys minted between neighbours**: node ordering moved off array indexes, so deleting the first node of a 1000-node board emits 1 delete instead of 999 patches, and a move re-keys one node via longest-increasing-subsequence selection. With the churn gone, node and operation caps rise to 50k, server-side apply plans node writes in memory and flushes bulk upserts in bounded chunks, and dense boards collapse into one batched layer so per-frame cost tracks the viewport instead of the document.
- **Resize transforms content, not just the box**: a data-driven `aspectLocked` capability keeps text, media, and strokes from distorting while container shapes still honour Shift-to-constrain, images and videos adopt intrinsic pixel size once the texture resolves, and selection outlines hug visible pixels. Live previews run through GPU transforms with authoritative geometry written once on pointer-up, and label rasterization is deferred during the drag.
- **Touch gestures for boards and notifications**: file tree rows can be long-pressed and dragged onto a board on touch and pen, with hit testing via `elementsFromPoint` against a zone registry, drawer retraction to expose the board, and targets re-resolved after autoscroll and at release. Turn notifications gain a reusable `swipeDismiss` action that locks direction after 8px so vertical scrolling still wins.

### Bug Fixes

- Protocol subpath aliases resolve in the web build; SvelteKit's prefix aliasing had rewritten `@cohub/protocol/board-constants` into a path under `index.ts`
- Local undo survives draw gestures and remote rebases, and realtime echoes of your own transactions no longer clear `canUndo`
- Board create input is validated against a shared schema before side effects, recreate soft-deletes and revives nodes instead of hard deleting, and only `VERSION_CONFLICT` is treated as rebaseable rather than every HTTP 409
- Mobile navigation drops `?preview=` when switching sessions, so full-screen board preview no longer traps you
- Session scroll position is restored after layout settles
- Workspace previews open reliably, with streamlined space startup previews

## v1.111 — 2026-07-24

- **Space-local New Chat backgrounds**: New chat boards can load HTML backgrounds from a relative Space file path via authenticated preview sessions.

### Bug Fixes

- Unified workspace route context so sidebar layout prefs and turn notifications stay consistent across space/session targets.

## v1.110 — 2026-07-23

- **User-scoped label system for space pinning**: Replaced legacy space marks with a unified user-scoped label architecture (`user:pinned`), extending space bookmarking across core services, REST APIs, SDK, CLI (`spaces pin/unpin`), realtime events, and UI components.
- **Real-time model availability monitoring**: Introduced a slim Redis-cached `/api/models/status` endpoint aggregating probe telemetry and observed traffic metrics to display operational health dots and 8-hour heartbeat charts in the model selector.
- **Command palette space picker & tab filtering**: Added space tab filters (All, Mine, Pinned) with preference persistence, paginated scroll loading for space selection, and keyboard shortcuts to toggle sidebars.
- **Channel help and model management commands**: Introduced `/help` and `/models` channel commands to inspect model configurations, catalog options, and session status directly within gateway chat channels.

### Bug Fixes

- Restored migrated user-scoped sidebar labels following schema transition.
- Prevented file preview URLs from reverting to previously selected tabs when opened.
- Optimistically update space pin states in command palette items to eliminate toggle latency.

## v1.109 — 2026-07-23

- **Model availability in selector**: Live per-model status (operational / degraded / outage) with success-rate dots driven by observed traffic first, probe history as fallback, plus hover charts from 8h online heartbeats and 24h history.
- **Models status API & protocol**: New slim Redis-cached `/models/status` route and `@cohub/protocol` status types that compress the large router-status probe payload into UI-ready fields (rates, latency, heartbeats, history).
- **Thinking level presentation**: Clearer thinking-level UX across the composer, message bubble, and model catalog.

### Bug Fixes

- File preview URL no longer reverts to the previous tab when opening a preview.
- Hover-card availability tooltip no longer thrashing from a render cycle; history buckets and bar colors aligned with router-status windows.

## v1.108 — 2026-07-23

- **Conflict-aware file autosave**: File writes carry optional baselines and `mutationId`s so concurrent edits surface as 409 conflicts instead of silent overwrites; the web client keeps pending drafts, shows sync status, and recovers safely across File and Canvas previews.
- **Unified Preview Float mode**: File, Canvas, and Port previews share one `PreviewFloatChrome` shell with centralized layout coordination, adaptive Chat/Files mutual exclusion, and restore-friendly auto-collapse that does not pollute the layout snapshot.
- **Space default workspace layout**: Spaces can declare `ui.workspace.defaultLayout` in `.cohub/space.json` as a first-entry fallback; explicit `?preview=` and existing local prefs always win, and async config never clobbers a layout the user just changed.
- **Per-prompt thinking level**: Optional `thinkingLevel` flows through protocol, API, Agent, Worker, Gateway, SDK, CLI, and web—with a model-driven selector, one-shot overrides, and effective level persisted on turn meta for multi-client recovery.
- **Codex request profiles**: Models can opt into a Codex affinity profile that stamps session/thread headers, and forked sessions preserve affinity so prompt caching stays stable across continuations.

### Bug Fixes

- Recover context overflow from Chinese proxy messages and HTTP 413 with force-compact retry; allow turn finalize to recover from a premature interrupted status.
- Recover from stale dynamic imports; stop file preview crashes and duplicate reads on space switch; re-fit preview width after workspace geometry settles.
- Align sidebar highlight with the active preview, protect system sidebar labels, and fix Float-mode rail/tabs plus mobile thinking-level UX.

## v1.107 — 2026-07-22

- **Unified preview workspace**: File, port, and canvas previews now share one responsive shell with consistent tabs, mobile chrome, and pinned Focus / Float controls.
- **Canvas media and editing**: Native image and video renderers preserve aspect ratio and natural sizing, while continuous creation tools, snapping, resize behavior, and text auto-size make editing more predictable.
- **Theme-aware canvas**: Shape colors resolve from CSS theme tokens, including per-Space `theme.css`, with an expanded color parser and SVG export that preserve custom appearance.
- **Stable Mermaid interaction**: Rendered SVG survives DOM cleanup, and touch gestures stay isolated from the surrounding message timeline.

### Bug Fixes

- Prevent file, port, and canvas preview surfaces from overlapping during navigation.
- Retry upstream response failures in the Agent runtime.

## v1.106 — 2026-07-22

- **tldraw-inspired infinite canvas**: Rebuild `.covas` around a renderer-independent shape core and editor model (select/hand/text/note/geo/draw/arrow/eraser/frame) with branded coordinates, serial commit queue, multi-tab realtime sync, txId idempotency, and 409 rebase recovery that never drops local work.
- **Canvas rendering scale-up**: Quadtree spatial index, viewport culling, dirty per-item updates, texture LRU, and on-demand Pixi draws so idle canvases stop burning CPU and large boards stay responsive under pan/zoom/drag.
- **Urgency-layered agent streaming**: Flush text/thinking near frame time (~24ms) while tool progress stays coarser (250ms), with urgent events preempting coarser timers for smoother live replies.
- **Reliable Space Hook dispatch**: Match definitions in an internal `space_hook.dispatch` job and only create user-visible tasks when something matches; skip enqueue entirely when a space has no hooks.
- **Public Work SEO + SDK canvas conflicts**: Publish extracts `lang` / `theme-color` into Work meta for SSR `og:locale`, theme-color, and JSON-LD; SDK/CLI export `CanvasTransactionError` for structured canvas conflict recovery.

### Bug Fixes

- Retry transient LLM failures in the agent session runtime.
- Persist preview focus/float layout across reloads; pin session task tray with better turn-rail clearance.
- Stop IndexedDB open-timeout warn storms; escape raw HTML in markdown; clip mobile chat selection to the timeline.
- Stamp streaming previews with server chunk time; resolve Work PWA icons against content URL and skip SVG for og:image.

## v1.105 — 2026-07-20

- **Product docs site**: Self-hosted `/docs` surface with English and Chinese guides, client search, language switch, TOC, copy-markdown, and SEO (canonical, hreflang, JSON-LD, sitemap alternates).
- **Work page meta on publish + public SSR**: Publish extracts title/description/icon/image from HTML head, packs companion assets for single-file Works, and materializes them into work/version meta; public Work and profile pages SSR share/OG tags, Work favicons, short Cache-Control, and soft-fail to client load when the API is unreachable.
- **Share branding with `hideCohubBar`**: Public preview meta follows presentation entitlement — default keeps a light Cohub host signal; `hideCohubBar` switches title/site_name to minimal Work branding and resolves root-relative media against the published content URL.
- **Home bootstrap checkpoint**: First-time Home spaces fork from `HOME_BOOTSTRAP_CHECKPOINT_ID` when set, otherwise still create a blank workspace.
- **Process cost in chat**: Collapsed ProcessCard shows intermediate-only usage cost (not full turn totals), with shared token/cost format helpers.

### Bug Fixes

- WorkSurface no longer SSR-crashes on public Work pages; mount surface only on the client.
- Public header is sticky/unified across pages with a mobile hamburger menu and overflow fixes.
- Open `.covas` canvas manifests as text (`application/json`) and recover legacy base64 binary previews.
- Billing catalog scoped to Cohub products.

## v1.104 — 2026-07-20

- **Turn-finalize hook filters**: `session.turn.finalized` hooks can match with `sessionIds`, `ignoreSessionIds`, and turn `sources` (e.g. `web_app`, `cli`), keeping trigger filters orthogonal to `prompt.sessionId`.
- **Stable hook env for shell scripts**: Optional `COHUB_HOOK_*` keys are always exported (empty string when absent), so `run` scripts under `set -u` stay safe.
- **Smarter hook definition cache**: Empty hook sets use a 30s negative cache TTL to cut readdir IO while recovering quickly from transient PVC misses; task results expose `definitionsCount` and `cache` hit/miss for easier debugging.

### Bug Fixes

- Optional hook context env vars no longer disappear when unbound, avoiding `set -u` failures in hook scripts.

## v1.103 — 2026-07-20

- **Space Hooks**: File-declared automation under `.cohub/hooks/*` — trigger `run` (sandbox shell) or `prompt` (session) actions on domain events (`space.fs.changed`, `space.workspace.ready`, `session.turn.finalized`, `checkpoint.created`).
- **Local event fan-out**: API, Worker, Agent, and Gateway enqueue hook tasks directly via BullMQ alongside realtime publish — no HTTP hop or second PubSub consumer.
- **Hook execution pipeline**: Worker resolves Space owner, caches definitions in Redis (5 min TTL with invalidation on hook file changes), matches with picomatch globs, and reuses existing `run_command` / session prompt chains with curated `COHUB_HOOK_*` env.
- **Architecture cleanup**: Hook envelope lives in `@cohub/protocol`; enqueue helper in `@cohub/infra/space-hooks` to keep package boundaries clean and drop core→infra coupling.

### Bug Fixes

- BullMQ-safe run jobIds; hook failures no longer fail or retry-storm the parent task
- FS matching always ignores `.cohub/**` to prevent self-trigger loops; skip hook enqueue on workspace resync

## v1.102 — 2026-07-18

- **Request provenance headers**: Introduce `X-Cohub-Source-*` (space, session, turn, tool call, via) across protocol, SDK, CLI, and API so HTTP calls carry caller identity into session channels and work/space/generation/checkpoint meta without touching authz.
- **Cross-space reference indexing**: Successful `/api/spaces/:id` requests from another space (e.g. `cohub -s` in a sandbox) now record `tool_call` edges with route method/path/pattern, requiring `turnId` and incrementing per hit within a turn.
- **Reference write modes**: `writeReferences` supports `set` (idempotent retries/backfill) and `increment` (live cross-space accumulation), written in separate statements so modes never corrupt each other.
- **Backfill performance**: Resource-references backfill queries by indexed `session_id` plus batched turn ids, with write batching, resume, and progress logging for large DBs.

### Bug Fixes

- Alias `@cohub/protocol/provenance` in the web Vite build so provenance imports resolve correctly.

## v1.101 — 2026-07-16

- **Resource references graph**: Rebuild `resource_references` as a directed graph — turn-level content edges, structural edges with denormalized `sourceSpaceId`/`sourceSessionId`, agent file-access kinds (`read`/`write`/`edit`/`ls`/`find`/`grep`), batch space authz, and `groupBy=target` aggregates for file-heat rankings.
- **Home space bootstrap**: Empty accounts now get a blank Home space (`slug=home`) via `GET /spaces/default`, so first entry lands in a real space instead of `/spaces/new`; POST and ensure share one create/provision path.
- **Landing narrative**: Refresh the public site around @space and Live Work — How it works, differentiators, a more realistic hero demo, and Web/CLI/API/Scheduled as primary surfaces.
- **References surface cleanup**: Drop redundant participant edges (authorship already lives on turns), query by `turn:<uuid>`, and expose the graph model through SDK and CLI.

### Bug Fixes

- Keep dismissed composer viewport-context chips sticky until the active preview source actually changes, so they no longer reappear after every send.

## v1.100 — 2026-07-16

- **Default usernames via Logto**: New accounts get a username from the email local part (slugified, with wide random suffixes and a UUID fallback), written to Logto first so identity never diverges from the source of truth.
- **Account email on profile**: `/api/me` resolves and returns the signed-in user’s email; Settings → Profile surfaces it next to the account ID.
- **Session scroll restore**: Re-entering a chat re-applies the leave anchor immediately, survives `{#key}` remounts and markdown reflow, and keeps restore state isolated per session so scroll no longer lands at the top.
- **Profile updates for execution tokens**: Profile writes fall back to the stored Logto user id when the token has no `sub`, so non-browser principals can still update profile.

### Bug Fixes

- Media lightbox: right-click on images opens the browser context menu again (copy image / save), instead of being captured by pan/zoom.
- Scroll anchor Map writes reassign under `$state.raw` so persisted leave positions actually notify consumers.

## v1.99 — 2026-07-15

- **Preview mark**: Capture port/HTML iframes or image previews into a frozen frame, then crop, annotate, and attach the result to chat through the existing image pipeline.
- **Global mark capture**: ⌘/Ctrl+Shift+S starts capture from anywhere; mark UI floats as a portal overlay with copy support and lighter cancel feedback.
- **Zoomable media lightbox**: Open chat attachment images with pinch/trackpad zoom, pan, and keyboard shortcuts for smoother review.
- **Public changelog**: New `/changelog` page with sticky version navigation, shared public header, and agent-powered entry generation from real git diffs—wired into Help, the command palette, and release scripts.
- **SSR public pages & SEO**: Marketing routes render on the server with canonical meta, sitemap, and a session-aware home redirect that avoids marketing flash for returning users.
- **Landing redesign**: Public homepage rebuilt around a CSS/SVG living-space demo, concept glossary, and idea art — no media placeholders.
- **Work publish provenance**: Work versions store optional source space/session/turn metadata; CLI auto-fills from sandbox `COHUB_*` env on publish paths across API, SDK, and schema.
- **Models API streaming**: Agent and completion LLM calls move from `pi-ai/compat` onto the official `createModels` path, with registry-catalog adapter caching across rounds while auth still resolves live per request.
- **Sandbox connect wait**: Agent dial path waits for resume/report instead of failing tool RPC while a sandbox is recovering or missing an endpoint.
- **Stack & open-source prep**: TypeScript 7 and Vite 8 with Rolldown; Apache-2.0 licensing, opt-in OTLP tracing (off by default), optional hosted billing, and hardened self-hosting/security docs.

### Bug Fixes

- Stop silent SSO callback redirect loops after a completed login, with safer redirect-path sanitization.
- Keep warm label-tree cache on first paint by not counting IndexedDB open races toward cache wipe recovery.
- Reduce sidebar fork-row flicker and improve media lightbox trackpad zoom and backdrop close.
- Default system worker shutdown timeout to 5 minutes so long-running system jobs are not cut off early.
- Stop still-streaming sessions from painting into empty `/new` chat drafts while preserving mid-send adopt handoff
- Archive intermediate rounds without stale tool previews; restore waiting footer between rounds and session scroll when the leave anchor is the assistant
- Harden sidebar cache so chats never stick on Loading after label items return
- Stabilize Safari @ mention caret reactivity; make markdown file preview resilient to lazy import failures
- Harden preview-mark capture against Chrome Element Capture hangs and gesture-gated start failures
- Clear residual stream state so queued follow-up turns never paint the previous generation
- Open empty/config dotfiles like `.npmrc` as text instead of binary octet-stream; soft-fail inline previews with Retry/Download
- Remove the stray Last save row from the new checkpoint page
- Align left/right sidebar item spacing and sessions header density, including mobile brand surface

## v1.98 — 2026-07-14

- **Cross-space New chat**: Starting a chat from `/sessions` now stays on the sessions inbox (`/sessions/new?space=…`) with a command-palette space picker, draft chrome, and in-place space switching instead of jumping into a space workspace.
- **Sessions shell architecture**: Shared `sessions/+layout` keeps the inbox page mounted across list, draft, and detail routes so the left list no longer remounts or jumps; draft targets use `newChatSpaceId` so they never fight global sidebar layout prefs.
- **Settings exit navigation**: Entering settings records the prior page, tab switches use `replaceState`, and leave uses `history.back()` (or the last space) so return is one step and no longer drops you on the public home.

### Bug Fixes

- Long turn navigator previews truncate to ~180 chars with a full-text tooltip instead of overflowing the rail and bottom sheet.
- Settings deep links (billing, referrals, channels) preserve the `from` return path across sub-routes.

## v1.97 — 2026-07-14

- **Skill slash commands**: Type `/skill:name` in the composer to expand platform, mod, user, and project skills on send — cataloged in the slash menu with Redis-backed discovery, plus `skills.list` in the SDK and CLI.
- **Workspace motion shell**: Desktop left/right panels and preview columns clip open and closed with shared motion tokens; mobile `/sessions` opens chats with an IM-style view transition, while resize and reduced-motion stay instant.
- **File tree drag-move**: Drag files and folders onto targets in the tree to `fs.move`, with hardened panel hide/collapse so previews stay mounted and interactions remain reliable.
- **Sessions continuity**: Desktop `/sessions` restores the last chat (or newest fallback), re-entry keeps scroll position, and session bootstrap skips double-fetches and no-op turn/presence refreshes.

### Bug Fixes

- Turn rail markers map by document position and chat chrome height so the minimap aligns with the timeline
- Label as picker anchors near its trigger on desktop and uses a safe-area bottom sheet on mobile
- Files column collapsed state persists across reloads; first-press header collapse is reliable
- HTML preview no longer loops createPreviewSession; file preview opens before a URL race can close it
- Sessions composer pins to the bottom; Focus my chats (⌘⇧U) works while typing

## v1.96 — 2026-07-14

- **Main/Files workspace columns**: Space shell splits into independent Main and Files columns with deep-linkable `?preview=` state, unified file/canvas/port tabs, and bi-directional URL sync so chat switches keep the open preview.
- **Shared session-chat module**: Full chat host, generation, scroll, and realtime lifecycle extracted into `features/session-chat` for Space and Sessions—refcounted space rooms, multi-host-safe generation leases, and a slimmer workspace page.
- **Richer turn navigator**: Turn index exposes intent and author profiles; the rail and bottom sheet show compact labels, timestamps, image placeholders, and multi-author names without heavier payloads.
- **Unlimited owned spaces**: Free-plan owned-space quota and entitlement gate removed so any account can create unlimited spaces.
- **Account-scoped work viewers**: `user.space.list` / `user.session.list` / `user.usage.read` still gate on the work grant, but data loads via `asAccountIdentity` so cross-space lists no longer collapse to the Work space.

### Bug Fixes

- Sanitize auth tokens in SDK transport and web client so Safari no longer throws on Authorization headers with CR/LF from corrupted storage.
- Hardened dual-host generation: lease under-release no-ops, stale stream `patchSeq` drops, mid-send draft persistence, and space-switch composer reset.
- Stopped session-chat effect loops freezing mobile UI; drawer pointer-events only while open or dragging.
- Portaled floating menus escape workspace stacking/overflow; preview Focus/Float menu no longer mis-dismisses or anchors at top-left.

## v1.95 — 2026-07-13

- **Durable chat attachments**: Upload chat files once to public durable storage without a session, then materialize them into the sandbox on demand — with hardened gateway handling and a 1GB size limit aligned to space uploads.
- **Generation model discounts**: Apply plan-based multipliers from entitlement metadata at request time, snapshot pricing for billing retries, support free (zero-multiplier) generations, and surface official vs effective cost in SDK/CLI results.
- **Internal OSS materialize path**: When pulling durable public URLs into the sandbox, rewrite known CDN/OSS origins to the internal endpoint for faster in-cluster downloads.
- **Composer draft control**: Keep large composer drafts editable and controllable instead of locking up the input.

### Bug Fixes

- Channel `/model` overrides no longer fail due to comparing platform sender IDs to Cohub user UUIDs.
- Generation pricing and discount fields are redacted from collaborator task views so plan tier cannot leak.

## v1.94 — 2026-07-13

- **Sessions inbox**: cross-space `/sessions` list with split list+conversation on desktop and fast branch-query listing on the API
- **Public profiles**: guest-facing `/:username` pages with discoverable spaces and works, plus identity links from presence, chat, and explore
- **Viewport context**: active file, canvas, or port chips in the composer send structured view metadata with each agent prompt
- **Referral rewards**: end-to-end referral program across API, billing, SDK/CLI, and settings UI
- **System queue postprocess**: session message postprocessing moved to a dedicated system worker queue for more reliable redrive

### Bug Fixes

- Recover sandboxes on unreachable endpoints, close idle_check loops on recover, and unify idle reaper scheduling
- Preserve session inbox order and unblock message postprocess redrive

## v1.93 — 2026-07-10

- **Raw space completions**: New `POST /spaces/:id/completions` API for full-control LLM calls (messages, system prompt file, thinking level) with JSON or SSE streaming, model catalog resolution, billing (`generation.llm.raw`), and S3 completion archives — exposed via SDK (`completion` / `streamCompletion`) and CLI (`cohub completion`).
- **File Diff mode**: File workspace and inline panels gain a Source / Preview / Diff segmented control that loads pending changes since last save, with shared diff rendering reused by checkpoint diffs.
- **Post-save checkpoint handoff**: Watching a `save_checkpoint` task complete now auto-opens the new checkpoint detail; opening an already-finished historical task stays on the task page.

### Bug Fixes

- Indent nested label items under child labels in the sidebar
- Passthrough remote image URLs in raw completions so Cohub never downloads image bytes for the model

## v1.92 — 2026-07-10

- **Multimodal generation billing**: Successful image, video, and music generations now charge the shared credit balance with idempotent `recordUsage`, post-success billing metadata, and a dedicated `generation.billing_retry` worker path for failed charges.
- **Generation usage stats & trending**: Hourly `generation_usage_stats_hourly` rollups mirror LLM token stats and power separate Generation leaderboards (spaces, users, models) beside the existing token-ranked boards.
- **User-scoped cache isolation**: IndexedDB partitions prefer stable user identity over guest, wait for auth hydration, and still network-fetch when cache identity is unavailable so cold starts never leak or permanently miss private data.

### Bug Fixes

- Command palette keeps Run Command / New Space local, reserved, and always visible instead of waiting on IndexedDB or remote search.
- Sidebar channel labels resolve from space bindings with provider icons instead of falling back to short ids.

## v1.91 — 2026-07-10

- **Checkpoint diffs**: Parent and pending workspace diffs are precomputed on save and available across API, SDK, CLI, and Web—including a lazy pending preview that avoids hammering NFS.
- **Session Channel labels**: Channel-origin sessions are auto-labeled under a system Channel tree (aligned with User labels) and shown in the sidebar Chats view, with a backfill script for existing data.
- **Generation metadata**: Generation results now store provider `request_id` and usage cost end-to-end via the upgraded generation SDK.

### Bug Fixes

- Recover from IndexedDB version mismatches on stale clients with a one-shot reload and hard-refresh guidance
- Prevent session timeline `each_key_duplicate` crashes after generation turn handoff
- Make sidebar label “Load more” full-width clickable

## v1.90 — 2026-07-09

- **Channel runtime health**: Gateway now writes structured ready/error/degraded status to Redis, exposes it on channel list APIs, and shows status pills with error summaries in Settings and Space Settings—new providers get baseline lifecycle health automatically.
- **Unified billing 402s**: Billing-gated failures and soft debt warnings share a flat `{ code, message, billing }` payload across API, SDK, WebSocket, and CLI, with shared serializers and helpers for blocked-access detection.
- **Label sidebar hydration**: Label items return fully hydrated sessions and forks in one response (with view filtering and shared fork redaction), eliminating N+1 avatar gaps on Load more and deferring All-chats network load until expanded.
- **Context overflow recovery**: Agents force-compact and retry when providers report context overflow, scaling reserve tokens to the model window and aborting empty retries when compaction cannot free enough room.
- **Theme semantic tokens**: Chat, sidebar, and app backgrounds gain semantic theme tokens, with Neta Studio chrome and slate canvas polish across light/dark variants.

### Bug Fixes

- Contain Mermaid syntax errors in-place so invalid diagrams no longer leak huge SVGs and break page layout
- Preview text files served via CDN URLs with MIME-aware inline UTF-8 hydration
- Handle TOCTOU races in space-fs inline reads with typed errors and richer telemetry
- Tier checkpoint-fs blob cache TTLs by size so large fulltext blobs stop dominating Redis

## v1.89 — 2026-07-09

- **QQ channel provider**: full gateway adapter and channel setup flow for QQ Open Platform bots, including streaming replies and media send/receive.
- **Native channel media**: outbound replies on Feishu, WeChat, and QQ deliver images and files as native attachments; inbound media from QQ, Discord, Feishu, and WeChat is ingested into durable Cohub assets with shared SSRF-safe fetch.
- **Mention triggers**: space channel settings can require @mentions in Discord guild channels and Feishu groups before the agent responds.
- **Owned-space entitlement**: free plans are limited to one owned space via `space.owned.unlimited`, with unified `feature_not_entitled` 402 gates that open the shared upgrade UI.
- **Space settings UX**: settings use continuous scroll with hash-linked sections, scroll-spy nav, and copyable mod space IDs.

### Bug Fixes

- Validate cross-space tool `space_id` values as UUIDs before query routing
- Encode label item cursor comparisons correctly so pagination stays stable
- Normalize QQ inbound attachment CDN URLs and map QQ/Telegram session label sources
- Return API unauthorized responses without throwing through the global error path
- Handle missing Logto user cleanly on profile update

## v1.88 — 2026-07-08

- **Sandbox compute specs**: Choose Standard, Boost, or Ultra CPU/memory tiers per space, with plan-gated entitlements, live Kubernetes pod resize (no restart when possible), and full API/CLI/SDK support.
- **Space settings redesign**: Two-pane section navigation, settings-row layout, skeleton loading, and a focused sandbox spec picker for clearer, faster configuration.
- **Work PWA polish**: Dedicated Work icons, maskable assets, and richer web manifest metadata so published Works install more cleanly as progressive apps.
- **Work runtime guide**: New agent-oriented SDK docs that make Work runtime capabilities easier to discover and integrate.
- **Search & Discord reliability**: Faster global search via materialized CTEs and trigram operators; Discord outbound splits preserve fenced code blocks, suppress unintended mentions, and send typing indicators.

### Bug Fixes

- Correct Kubernetes pod resize subresource usage when applying sandbox specs
- Gate higher sandbox specs by billing benefit keys and fall back cleanly when resize cannot apply immediately
- Limit turn search to substring matching to avoid noisy similarity hits

## v1.87 — 2026-07-08

- **Cross-space turn notifications**: When an agent turn finishes in any space, you get a compact in-app toast with space identity, status, duration, step count, and a preview of your prompt — open the turn in the current or a new tab, or dismiss it.
- **Desktop & PWA alerts**: Optional browser notifications fire when the tab is in the background, with a gentle permission prompt and service-worker click handling that focuses or navigates to the finished turn reliably.
- **User-scoped realtime notify channel**: Agent and API emit a new `session.turn.notify` event to the user's personal room on turn finalize, and the SDK exposes `onUserEvent` so clients can subscribe without binding to a single space.
- **Smart suppress & multi-tab presence**: Notifications are suppressed when you are already focused on that session; BroadcastChannel + localStorage presence keeps other tabs quiet if one tab is actively viewing it.

### Bug Fixes

- Browser notification clicks now correctly focus an existing window or open the target session URL via the PWA service worker.

## v1.86 — 2026-07-08

- **Multi-preview tabs**: Open and switch between multiple file, canvas, and port previews in the space workspace, with a redesigned tab bar and unified panel chrome.
- **Neta Studio theme**: New appearance theme aligned with the canvas skin, available in settings with matching editor and Mermaid styling.
- **Preview chrome polish**: Consistent headers across file, canvas, and port panels, type icons in tabs, and cleaner close/focus controls.

### Bug Fixes

- Keep preview lazy imports stable so panel remounts do not reload modules unnecessarily.
- Limit tool input detail height to avoid oversized overflow in chat tool views.

## v1.85 — 2026-07-07

- **Channel model selection**: Bind a preferred model per channel from space settings and creation flows, with catalog-aware validation across platform and user model configs.
- **Private HTML previews**: Serve private HTML files from a dedicated preview origin using short-lived signed preview sessions, keeping previews isolated without leaking main-app credentials.
- **Work bridge core in SDK**: Extract framework-agnostic `createWorkBridgeCore` (plus grant cache) into `@neta-art/cohub` so external hosts can reuse token minting, authorization, and purchase flows without reimplementing the bridge.
- **Faster global search**: Optimize search queries with new indexes so Command Palette results stay snappy at scale.

### Bug Fixes

- Keep the sidebar usable when the label cache fails to load.
- Re-authorize viewer scopes when work runtime tokens refresh.
- Prevent the preview router from intercepting internal API routes.

## v1.84 — 2026-07-07

- **Standalone work auth broker**: Works running outside the Cohub iframe can authorize via a popup broker (`/work-auth`) with origin allowlisting, one-shot postMessage handshake, and restricted-token persistence across reloads.
- **Work runtime transport layer**: SDK `WorkRuntime` is transport-agnostic — `ParentBridgeTransport` for iframe embeds and `PopupBrokerTransport` for standalone deploys, with auto-detection from `CohubClientOptions.work`.
- **Bridge host extraction**: WorkSurface bridge logic, authorize, and purchase dialogs are split into reusable `createWorkBridgeHost` + dialog components shared by embed and broker flows.
- **Authorize consent UX**: Work authorize dialog groups requested scopes into plain-language operations, shows work/author context, usage notes, and 14-day validity.
- **YAML block scalars in skills**: Agent frontmatter parsing now supports folded (`>`) and literal (`|`) multi-line skill descriptions instead of truncating them.

### Bug Fixes

- Sidebar shows user labels after source labels.
- Skill descriptions using multi-line YAML frontmatter no longer collapse to `>` or `|` in system prompts.

## v1.83 — 2026-07-07

- **Sidebar source labels**: Chats are organized under system Source labels (Web App, CLI, scheduled tasks, etc.) with user labels first, activity-ordered system lists, and an All Chats fallback—replacing the separate Chats section.
- **Unified access states**: Space and session permission failures share one AccessState model and AccessStateView for not-found, forbidden, sign-in-required, limited, and generic errors—including route-level error pages.
- **Per-round auto-compaction**: Context compaction now runs before each LLM round via transformContext, so long agent turns can compact mid-turn with correct sequence bookkeeping instead of only pre-turn.
- **Streaming tool UX**: Tool partial results stream as append patches; live tool output and collapsed input panels auto-follow the tail while you scroll freely when needed.
- **Background task steering**: Completed background bash tasks re-enter the agent loop with steer intent so the session continues from the task result.

### Bug Fixes

- Stabilize streaming markdown spacing so live-to-stable promotion no longer jumps paragraphs.
- Keep label item caches and ordering fresh as sessions update.

## v1.82 — 2026-07-06

- **Local space filesystem over relay RPC**: Web FS for local spaces now goes through sandbox relay — new `fs.tree` capability, richer `fs.read`/`fs.stat`/`fs.write` metadata, exclusive create, and live `fs.changed` events without an attached agent.
- **Dedicated FS API deployment**: Split space FS and checkpoint FS traffic onto `cohub-fs-api` with higher memory and dedicated routing, isolating file I/O from the core API.
- **Sandbox node pool scheduling**: Sandbox pods can target dedicated node pools via configurable nodeSelector and tolerations.
- **Realtime context compaction**: Agents publish the compacted system message over the WebSocket stream so clients see compaction notices immediately.
- **Work asset CDN base URL**: Configurable CDN origin for work asset delivery.

### Bug Fixes

- Composer stays responsive with large drafts
- Map virtual `/workspace` to the fenced root in local sandboxes so FS/process RPCs no longer ACCESS_DENIED
- Route local cross-space queries through the sandbox
- Serialize gateway inbound binding events to avoid races

## v1.81 — 2026-07-05

- **Local sandbox**: run a space against a local dial-out `sandboxd` via gateway relay, with `cohub sandbox up`/`status`, path fencing, and managed cross-platform binary download.
- **Resource references index**: rebuildable turn-granular graph of forks, mentions, tool calls, mods, and participants, with live double-writes plus query/aggregate APIs, SDK, and CLI.
- **Sandbox architecture**: extract `@cohub/sandbox-client` and a reusable Go session layer; add immutable `cloud|local` provider on space sandboxes and short-circuit cloud lifecycle for local.
- **Work home screen shortcuts**: public work URLs install as home screen shortcuts via a dedicated webmanifest.

### Bug Fixes

- Hydrate sidebar spaces from the local cache on mount so reopening the drawer does not flash an empty space selector.

## v1.80 — 2026-07-03

- **Home screen shortcuts**: Add installable web app shortcuts for Spaces and Works so they can be launched directly from the device home screen.
- **Incremental label patching**: Introduce partial resource label updates across API, SDK, CLI, and web, avoiding full label rewrites for faster, safer edits.
- **Async work asset publishing**: Move Work asset publishing off the API path onto a system worker queue for more reliable, scalable publish throughput.
- **Generation stream runtime**: Refactor session generation realtime handling and improve streaming scroll-follow so live turns feel smoother and more stable.
- **Agent image normalization**: Normalize and guard image inputs before LLM calls to reduce oversized payloads and prevent empty bash output from being treated as images.

### Bug Fixes

- Resolve each_key_duplicate crash in running-turn process cards
- Show current user avatar correctly in shared session sidebar rows
- Isolate turn execution auth and reset residual per-turn state on error paths to prevent cross-turn leakage
- Show source badges in label sessions

## v1.79 — 2026-07-03

- **Session auto-compaction**: Long agent sessions now compact automatically before a turn when context crosses the threshold — LLM summary, session-file archive/rewrite, agent-state rebuild, and a durable compact turn in the DB (with expandable UI divider).
- **Compaction-aware session files**: SessionManager archives full pre-compaction history, rewrites a trimmed root, and can recover branch forks from the archive chain when entries were compacted away.
- **Session append I/O**: Persistent WriteStream for session.jsonl appends, with the fd flushed and released between turns instead of held across idle periods.
- **Streaming text animation**: Replaced per-word tokenization with a lightweight stable/tail split for smoother, cheaper stream rendering.

### Bug Fixes

- Bill LLM usage for every persisted assistant message (including intermediate tool rounds), not only the final reply.
- Compaction edge cases: skip empty summarize, omit inaccurate tokensAfter in the UI, fix turnId/sequence resolution, and restore from archive if DB persistence fails.

## v1.78 — 2026-07-02

- **Session participant labels**: Sessions automatically get system `User/<id>` labels for participants, with protected system assignments, fork inheritance, and a backfill path.
- **Streaming markdown split**: Chat streaming now renders stable and live tail regions separately, cutting re-parse/re-render CPU while the reply is still growing.
- **User profile cache**: Web client caches user profiles in IndexedDB and stabilizes label/profile hydration so avatars and names stay consistent under realtime updates.
- **Agent session reliability**: Session JSONL is streamed more efficiently, user-message indexes avoid redundant work, and handles settle (persist/flush/signature) before lock release.

### Bug Fixes

- Inherit parent session labels when forking
- Hydrate turn author profiles on realtime `session.turn.created` events
- Stabilize trending list keys to avoid row remount flicker
- Allow non-dashed user ids in session participant labels

## v1.77 — 2026-07-01

- **Work credit commerce**: Sell credit packs and consume balances with a closed loop — `cohub_credit` benefits, `GET entitlements` (features + balance), and idempotent `POST credits/consume` across billing, API, SDK, CLI, and the benefit editor.
- **Space danmaku**: Other users' messages float across the workspace from realtime turn events; pills are clickable to open the source session, with throttle, concurrency caps, reduced-motion support, and a presence-popover toggle.
- **Markdown line links**: File links can target specific lines and open the editor or preview at that location while preserving workspace paths.
- **Draft session model memory**: Manually chosen models for new sessions persist in localStorage and restore only when still present in the live catalog.

### Bug Fixes

- SDK debug HAR/log export redacts tokens, JWTs, API keys, and secret-bearing query params in request bodies, WebSocket frames, and console output — not only headers.

## v1.76 — 2026-06-30

- **Work Commerce**: sell one-time products from published Works with feature unlocks, credit benefits, host-owned checkout, and runtime APIs across server, SDK, CLI, and web.
- **Space commerce management**: redesign the commerce settings UI and CLI surface for products, benefits, bindings, and orders, gated by dedicated permissions and Max/Internal entitlement.
- **Workspace file links**: open relative and workspace file links from markdown previews and chat content directly in the file workspace.
- **Chat process reliability**: harden intermediate-step loading with explicit sync/retry states and graceful degradation when session-turns cache reads or writes fail.

### Bug Fixes

- Handle uninitialized space commerce state without hard failures in settings and API flows.
- Polish presence popover behavior and keep agent user-context config paths out of prompts.

## v1.75 — 2026-06-29

- **Work visibility**: Works support `public` vs `space` access — space-scoped pages, sessions, and authorize flows require `space.view`, with matching publish/edit UI and API fields.
- **Versioned publishing**: Publishing is split from metadata updates — `POST /works/:id/versions` snapshots content, status is only `published`/`disabled` (draft removed), and public content always serves the current version.
- **Actor-aware agent runtime**: Sessions bind to the acting user for model registry, LiteLLM tracking, and system prompt context; user skills load only for the space owner, with live `configureRuntimeIdentity` swaps.
- **Presence popover**: The space presence stack opens a polished online list (desktop popover / mobile sheet) with richer activity labels across chats, files, works, tasks, and more.
- **Immutable asset caching**: Public OSS uploads (chat attachments, turn objects, work assets) set `Cache-Control: public, max-age=31536000, immutable` for long-lived CDN hits.

### Bug Fixes

- Keep work edit/publish action bars sticky and visible while scrolling the detail form.
- CLI generation commands accept media role inputs for multimodal generation workflows.

## v1.74 — 2026-06-28

- **Space presence**: Live who-is-online indicator in the workspace header, backed by presence snapshots, `presence.update` websocket events, and SDK `space.presence` / `updatePresence` APIs with optional activity meta.
- **Room-based realtime routing**: Gateway and SDK now subscribe to explicit `space:` / `user:` rooms instead of fan-out by audience lists, with retain/release room subscriptions and cleaner event delivery.
- **Default space resolution**: New `GET /api/spaces/default` (and SDK `spaces.getDefault()`) returns the user's home space or most recently active accessible space.
- **Gateway outbound reliability**: Per-node outbound streams with channel rebind migration, delivery retries, and safer websocket client error handling.

### Bug Fixes

- Mobile chat shell scrolling
- Realtime task events incorrectly routed off user rooms

## v1.73 — 2026-06-27

- **Mod prompt templates**: Enabled space mods contribute `.agents/prompts` into the shared prompt catalog (API + worker), with a new `mod` scope and revision-aware Redis caching.
- **Cohub Ask UI**: `cohub-ask` / `ask-user-question` fenced blocks render as interactive question cards; option clicks (single or multi-select) insert into the composer without stealing focus.
- **Enriched Works API**: `works.get` now returns `publicUrl`, `content`, `owner`, and `space` alongside the work record; SDK types and CLI surface public/content URLs.
- **Hide Cohub bar**: Work detail settings let Pro/Max owners toggle public-page Cohub footer visibility via presentation meta.
- **Streaming snapshot merge**: Intermediate stream recovery uses stable turn-scoped message IDs and a shared merge/dedupe path so live and persisted assistants stay consistent.

### Bug Fixes

- Deduped recovered streaming intermediate messages that could appear twice after reconnect or snapshot enrichment.
- Running process details load correctly after refresh when live intermediate state is empty.
- Background bash task user messages use distinct styling and labeling in chat.

## v1.72 — 2026-06-27

- **CLI profile & space slugs**: Update public usernames and Space slugs from the CLI (`profile update`, `spaces update`) for public Work URLs.
- **CLI space context**: `spaces get` can use the configured target Space and surfaces slug in output.

### Bug Fixes

- Streaming process panel no longer collapses incorrectly after refresh during an active turn.
- Prompt template loading tolerates a missing or empty platform templates directory.

## v1.71 — 2026-06-25

- **Immersive preview**: Expand workspace previews into a full immersive mode with tighter chrome and optional chat overlay visibility.
- **CLI `run` command**: Execute one-off shell commands in a Space workspace (`cohub -s <id> run -- …`), with sync wait or async queue.
- **Composer draft persistence**: Keep unsent chat drafts per session so reloads and session switches no longer drop in-progress input.
- **Generation stream recovery**: Stronger snapshot merge and resume paths across agent, SDK, and web so reconnects restore intermediate turns cleanly.
- **Mermaid interaction**: Pan/zoom diagrams more reliably, including pinch-to-zoom on touch devices.

### Bug Fixes

- Restore correct streaming turn rendering after generation recovery.
- Fix mobile member role selection in space settings.
- Keep the session task tray visible on compact shells; fall back failed image attachments to files.

## v1.70 — 2026-06-24

- **Activity-sorted spaces**: Spaces now track `lastActivityAt` (message and session activity) and list by recent use across API, sidebar, command palette, and mentions—backed by a dedicated index.
- **Hide Cohub bar on Works**: Pro and Max can hide the public work footer bar via publish UI, CLI (`--hide-cohub-bar` / `--show-cohub-bar`), and a billing entitlement check.
- **Silent work re-authorization**: Returning viewers reuse cached grants so consent prompts are skipped for previously approved scopes (local cache with periodic re-consent).
- **Sidebar Works first**: Works sits above Saves in the space sidebar for faster access to published surfaces.

### Bug Fixes

- Pricing page only shows public plans, so private catalog entries stay hidden.

## v1.69 — 2026-06-23

- **Account-level Works scopes**: Works can request `user.space.list`, `user.session.list`, and `user.usage.read` so viewers grant access to their own spaces, sessions, and usage—not just the host space.
- **Me sessions & usage APIs**: New `/api/me/sessions` and `/api/me/usage` endpoints, with SDK (`user.listSessions`, `user.getUsage`) and CLI (`cohub me sessions`, `cohub me usage`) for cross-space account data.
- **User-level permission model**: Permissions can now be account-scoped rather than space-bound; Work runtimes strip sensitive space fields when listing a viewer's spaces.
- **Shared usage aggregation**: Space and account usage endpoints share one aggregation path for hourly buckets and cost summaries.

### Bug Fixes

- Enforce a -$1 hard negative billing limit instead of -$1M.
- Resolve user-level permission checks before space-scoped auth so account scopes are not incorrectly denied.

## v1.68 — 2026-06-23

- **Landing redesign**: Refined home visual identity, public pages locked to dark theme, and routes split into layout groups for faster first-screen loads.
- **Prompt-scoped env**: `CreateSpacePromptInput` and scheduled send payloads accept per-turn `env`; CLI `prompt` / `spaces send` gain repeatable `--env KEY=value` with duplicate-key detection.
- **WeChat channel login**: `ChannelsApi.startWeChatLogin()` and `waitWeChatLogin()` with QR data URL and optional verify-code flow (`alreadyConnected` / `needVerifyCode`).
- **Checkpoint lineage**: `CheckpointRecord` adds optional `rootCheckpointId` and `saveVersion`, and makes `meta` optional for clearer fork tracing.

## v1.67 — 2026-06-23

- **Redesigned landing page**: New marketing home with product story, demo placeholders, and full SEO/Open Graph meta; public pages lock to dark theme before paint to avoid theme flash.
- **Public vs app route groups**: Split SvelteKit routes into `(public)` and `(app)` layouts so the authenticated shell no longer wraps marketing pages, improving landing first paint and isolation.
- **Prompt-scoped env vars**: Per-turn environment variables flow through API, SDK, agent sandbox bash, and scheduled tasks, with CLI `--env KEY=value` on `prompt` and `spaces send` (system keys reserved, validated limits).

## v1.66 — 2026-06-22

- **WeChat channel media**: inbound images and files now flow through gateway attachment plan/complete APIs into public assets and space uploads, with outbound image delivery over WeChat CDN.
- **WeChat login hardening**: QR connect supports verification codes, reuses existing bot tokens, and improves already-connected and session lifecycle handling.
- **Checkpoint stats**: saves record richer file change metrics (added, modified, deleted, renamed, copied, size) and surface them in the checkpoint detail view.
- **Gateway attachment pipeline**: new internal `/attachments/plan` and `/attachments/complete` routes with safe path checks, size limits, and sandbox upload completion.

### Bug Fixes

- Channel delete now returns clearer business errors and more reliable UI feedback.
- WeChat inbound messages correctly include image references.

## v1.65 — 2026-06-22

- **WeChat channels**: Connect WeChat bots via QR login, with a full gateway provider for inbound/outbound messaging and polished binding UI.
- **Session switch stability**: Key chat timelines by session, defer scroll restore until layout settles, and avoid empty frames when switching sessions.
- **Generation snapshot cache**: Persist in-flight session generation state in IndexedDB so refresh and multi-tab recovery stay reliable.
- **Theme & space switcher polish**: Smoother theme circle transitions and visible sync status in the space switcher.

### Bug Fixes

- Recover stale worker checkpoint git locks
- Sanitize Postgres JSON content that could break message storage
- Fix markdown first-frame fallback and session source label overlap
- Harden gateway channel recovery and WeChat submit flow

## v1.64 — 2026-06-21

- **Space workspace modularization**: Split the monolithic SpaceWorkspacePage into domain modules and controllers (session, files, cronjobs, task runs, works, checkpoints, canvas/port preview) with clearer state boundaries and route isolation.
- **Theme switch animation**: Appearance settings now use the View Transitions API for a circular reveal when changing themes, with reduced-motion support.
- **Space switcher freshness**: Command palette space ranking blends recent visits with session activity and can force-refresh the space list so the switcher stays current.

### Bug Fixes

- Preserve session scroll position before workspace navigation.
- Harden workspace route/controller resets so detail views and realtime state stay consistent across route switches.

## v1.63 — 2026-06-20

- **CDN chat images**: Chat attachments now upload to public asset storage and travel as stable CDN URL references instead of inline base64, across web, CLI (`--image`), SDK, API, and agent.
- **One-shot public asset uploads**: SDK and CLI gain `upload` / `uploadChatImageAttachment` helpers so clients no longer hand-roll presign + form POSTs for avatars and chat images.
- **Faster space boot cache**: Workspace startup assets—space styles and prompt templates—are cached in localStorage and restored immediately while silent refresh keeps them current.
- **Agent public-asset image loader**: The agent can resolve chat image URL blocks from object storage, so multimodal turns work with CDN-backed attachments end to end.

### Bug Fixes

- Keep chat attachment public URLs canonical (no cache-buster query) so agent and clients resolve the same object keys.
- Harden usage cost aggregation so non-finite values cannot corrupt totals, and derive missing `cost.total` from component costs.

## v1.62 — 2026-06-19

- **Work version publishing**: Works now keep an immutable version history—republish creates a new snapshot, and the management UI, API, and SDK expose current/latest version plus version lists.
- **Works CLI**: Manage Works from the terminal with `cohub works` (`ls`, `get`, `resolve`, `publish`, `update`, `versions`, `rm`), including force-publish and scope controls.
- **Space-scoped layout prefs**: Sidebar width and collapse state are stored per space (with legacy global fallback) so each workspace keeps its own layout.
- **Avatar pipeline**: Shared `UserAvatar` with OSS-resized delivery, plus upload encoding that falls back from WebP to JPEG when needed.

### Bug Fixes

- Stabilize session scroll position when reconciling chat tails and preserve unchanged turn object refs to reduce UI jump.
- Harden Work runtime parent-origin detection and clone Work/viewer permission scopes at the context bridge.

## v1.61 — 2026-06-19

- **Mermaid diagrams**: Render Mermaid flowcharts in chat markdown with zoom controls and SVG export
- **Checkpoint pagination**: Cursor-based listing across API, SDK, and CLI for large checkpoint histories
- **Session cache rewrite**: Indexed session list/detail repositories with bounded memory without truncating lists
- **Sidebar modularization**: Split resource rows into dedicated components with tighter label layout and file preview actions
- **Work surfaces**: Extract WorkSurface and support native work backgrounds

### Bug Fixes

- Stabilize session sidebar row updates and snapshot merge order
- Restore space file download actions and fix dotfile previews
- Make turn rail markers clickable; fix work runtime context race

## v1.60 — 2026-06-18

- **Invite role upgrades**: accepting a space invite can promote an existing lower-role member (for example guest to builder) without demoting, with shared role-rank helpers in core permissions.
- **Filesystem observability**: space and checkpoint FS APIs emit staged OpenTelemetry spans and timed stage logs for cache, git, CDN, and IO hotspots, with tunable detail via env flags.
- **ESM OpenTelemetry bootstrap**: API process starts with an import hook so OTEL ESM instrumentation loads correctly, and span filtering now runs at the processor layer.
- **Distributed tracing CORS**: allow and expose Tracestate, Baggage, and Sentry-Trace so browser clients can propagate full trace context.

### Bug Fixes

- Invite accept no longer returns 409 for existing members when the invite would upgrade their role.

## v1.59 — 2026-06-17

- **New chat space profile**: Fresh chats surface the space identity—name, description, creator, members, 7-day usage, and a live sandbox status pulse—with local cache for snappy loads and mobile expand/collapse.
- **Delegated prompt auth**: Work-session and delegated prompt scopes now flow end-to-end through agent turns, execution grants, background bash, and scheduled tasks so tools run with least-privilege permissions.
- **Permission scope normalization**: Shared helpers clean and compare scopes across API, work sessions, and execution grants, including scoped execution principals for agent-driven access checks.
- **Trending polish**: Model rankings resolve human-readable catalog names, and costs render as proper USD.

### Bug Fixes

- Sidebar chat rename now cancels on outside click.
- Usage cost display restores the currency prefix.

## v1.58 — 2026-06-16

- **Works lifecycle**: Manage Works end-to-end from the sidebar and space detail pages — get, update, disable, and delete with asset cleanup, plus matching SDK/API support.
- **Space home is chat**: Opening a space lands on new chat; profile and usage live under Space Settings for a cleaner workspace entry.
- **Billing catalog cache**: Static catalog data is cached in Redis (server) and a shared client store so pricing and plan UI load faster with fewer round-trips.
- **Work viewer permissions**: Works can grant `generation.create`, `file.view`, and `taskrun.view` scopes so shared public surfaces can generate and inspect task output.

### Bug Fixes

- Work delete returns to the space landing route instead of a stale detail page.

## v1.57 — 2026-06-16

- **Custom new chat backgrounds**: Spaces can declare background payloads in `.cohub/space.json`, with web rendering, external sandbox support, faster loading, and a stable composer layout.
- **Batch user profiles API**: New `/api/users/profiles/batch` endpoint and SDK client fetch up to 100 public profiles in one request, with cache-friendly responses.
- **Session model continuity**: Accepted turns store provider/model, and the composer restores the draft or latest turn model so model choice survives session create and send.
- **Partial agent search results**: Find and grep return partial matches when output limits are hit instead of failing the tool call.

### Bug Fixes

- Checkpoint config publish failures are recorded as structured `publishWarnings` on progress and checkpoint meta instead of only logging.

## v1.56 — 2026-06-16

- **Streaming find & grep**: Find and grep tools now stream throttled partial results while searches run, so long scans stay visible instead of blocking until completion.
- **Process argv exec**: Sandbox `process.start` supports direct argv mode (no shell) via a new `processStartArgv` capability, with size limits, diagnostics, and tracing.
- **Agent-owned remote search**: When argv exec is available, remote find/grep run through `fd`/`rg` with agent-owned argv, limits, abort, and formatting; legacy `fs.find`/`fs.grep` remains for older sandboxes.

## v1.55 — 2026-06-16

- **Reliable turn abort**: Agent aborts now cancel all active tool executions and in-flight sandbox processes for a turn, not just the top-level controller.
- **Sandbox process abort plumbing**: Bash/grep register per-process abort handles, capture RPC context for `process.abort`, and honor turn-level AbortSignals end-to-end.
- **Sandbox RPC reordering hardening**: WebSocket client resolves pending ops even when `rpc.event` / `rpc.completed` arrive before acceptance mapping, preventing lost results and stuck tools.
- **Preserved aborted tool output**: Tool results keep full `rawOutput` so abort/timeout paths still surface real command output in sessions and run-command progress.

### Bug Fixes

- Billing user-menu spacing tightened for denser rail/menu layout.
- Run-command jobs abort cleanly with a proper terminated result instead of failing as infrastructure errors.

## v1.54 — 2026-06-15

- **Pricing & conversion**: New global pricing page with monthly/yearly plans, sidebar plan entry, and a reusable billing usage gate that surfaces upgrade/conversion when limits are hit.
- **Unified Activity ledger**: Billing settings merge usage records and open overages into a single Activity feed with net balance, covering grants, consumes, refunds, and adjustments.
- **Billing package**: Extract `@cohub/billing` as a shared package with usage-gate, conversion helpers, and REST-aligned billing APIs used by API and worker.
- **Sandbox lifecycle**: Hardened hibernation and teardown cleanup so public network and infra state are torn down more reliably.
- **Trending & workspace polish**: Cache trending API responses, recommend the base mod in space settings, and speed up session task tray media previews.

### Bug Fixes

- Align trending table header and row columns across breakpoints.
- Guard usage cost against non-finite values and fix pricing balance display.

## v1.53 — 2026-06-12

- **Agent-owned session persistence**: moved turn and message persistence into the agent service with clearer boundaries, assistant-message normalization, and intermediate turn object storage.
- **Lazy new chat sessions**: draft chats open instantly via a dedicated new-session route, with quieter session creation and transitions that match the empty chat view.
- **Scheduled job management**: SDK and CLI now support cron job detail, patch updates, and paginated run history, with more reliable rescheduling and richer task/cron detail UI.
- **Faster workspace loads**: stale-while-revalidate space bootstrap, optimized session task loading, and finer Vite chunk splitting for markdown, Shiki, and CodeMirror to cut first-load weight and flicker.
- **Task and generation UX**: clearer progress, generation output, checkpoint detail, and session task tray—especially on mobile.

### Bug Fixes

- Persist intermediate agent turn objects correctly and isolate retry turns after claim failures
- Refresh cronjob sidebar after updates and keep open-sidebar working in new tabs
- Unblock space page loads when IndexedDB cache hangs; always revalidate session list against remote
- Restore mobile composer focus after send and allow read-only file downloads
- Harden worker config publish permissions and tighten BullMQ job retention

## v1.52 — 2026-06-11

- **Public Works**: publish HTML files, static directories, or sandbox ports from a space to shareable `/{username}/{space}/w/{slug}` pages, with asset storage, scoped work sessions, and viewer grants end-to-end (API, SDK, web).
- **Work publishing UI**: sidebar Works list, publish dialog (including directory entry), and a dedicated share page with faster loading and hardened slug/path validation.
- **Filtered workspace visibility**: agents honor `file.view` vs `file.view.filtered`, applying gitignore-aware path filtering across read, ls, find, and grep.
- **Double-click session rename**: rename sessions inline from the sidebar with click/double-click disambiguation.

### Bug Fixes

- Correct agent file-view filtering so filtered actors cannot probe ignored or unauthorized paths.
- Stabilize work share page loading when space metadata is incomplete.

## v1.51 — 2026-06-10

- **Model costs**: Selector shows per-million input, output, and cache pricing so you can pick models with cost in mind.
- **Hidden models**: Models can be marked hidden for pickers while remaining available at runtime; exact-ID search still finds them.
- **Faster space bootstrap**: Creating a space becomes ready after enqueueing the initial checkpoint instead of waiting on the full save, and blank workspaces tolerate existing files.
- **Simpler workspace layout**: Removed the custom space-layout system in favor of a lighter preview focus mode with reliable panel resizing.
- **Shared model catalog**: Web loads models through one store with indexed display-name resolution across chat, process cards, and session activity.

### Bug Fixes

- Checkpoint create returns 409 when a save is already in progress instead of enqueueing a duplicate.
- Turn rail markers hover and jump correctly without fighting the scroll track.
- Waiting status and sidebar activity show friendly model names instead of raw IDs.

## v1.50 — 2026-06-09

- **Checkpoint file browsing**: Inspect any checkpoint as a read-only file tree in the space sidebar, with matching API routes, SDK (`checkpoints(id).files`), and CLI (`ls-tree` / `show`). Backed by a git-based checkpoint FS layer with Redis caching and presigned asset delivery.
- **Suno music generation**: Add `suno_music` for songs, lyrics, sound effects, and related tasks; generation payloads rename `metadata` → `meta` across protocol, API, worker, SDK, and CLI.
- **Media markdown previews**: Standalone audio and video links/images in markdown render as native players with captions.
- **Workspace polish**: Turn navigator hover/connector behavior is tighter and more stable; selecting a model returns focus to the composer.

### Bug Fixes

- Unknown binary MIME types (e.g. `.zip`) are no longer treated as UTF-8 text, preventing file corruption.
- Billing credit grant lists filter non-displayable grants and surface `availableNow` / `unavailableReasons`.
- Checkpoint storage mounts and cache path layout no longer double-prefix subpaths.
- File tree loading no longer sticks in a stale loading state when switching sources.

## v1.49 — 2026-06-08

- **Realtime canvas sync**: Postgres-backed canvas documents with semantic op transactions over WebSocket, optimistic concurrency, undo/redo, and a durable client-side pending queue for resilient multiplayer editing.
- **Space layout & style**: Per-space workspace layout customization and custom style injection so spaces can control chrome, preview panes, and visual identity.
- **Label-scoped search**: Command palette, API, SDK, and CLI can filter by labels—including empty-query label browsing—for faster navigation across labeled resources.
- **Session navigation refresh**: Replaces split-mode session chrome with a streamlined turn navigator panel and simplified workspace routing.

### Bug Fixes

- Block guest access to prompts that should require authentication.
- Keep turn navigator hover and focus state in sync; stabilize preview layout menu state and loading feedback.

## v1.48 — 2026-06-05

- **Background bash tasks**: Agents can run long-lived shell work asynchronously, with a session task tray, realtime status, and IndexedDB-backed task-run caching across web, SDK, and CLI.
- **Follow-up prompt queue**: Queue, reorder, and manage pending follow-ups while a turn is running, with hardened actions and stable composer UX across API, web, and CLI.
- **LLM waiting lifecycle**: Expose generation waiting state end-to-end—agent runtime, realtime protocol, SDK stream helpers, and in-session runtime status UI.
- **Billing account management**: Expand billing APIs and the settings UI for richer account, plan, and payment workflows.
- **Agent turn dispatch rewrite**: Round-based batch claiming, session-level wakeups, and agent-issued execution grants replace turn-id jobs and shared signing keys.

### Bug Fixes

- Stop interrupting batched turns and skip locked wakeup retries so drain/follow-up dispatch stays reliable.
- Handle async bash sandbox RPC errors without dropping background command runs.
- Persist interrupted assistant snapshots and order follow-up actions by operation time.
- Fix sidebar session navigation, active label highlighting, and composer Enter-to-submit behavior.

## v1.47 — 2026-06-04

- **Voice input**: Speak into the session composer with Volc ASR—tap the mic to toggle, get partial transcripts live, and auto language detection end to end (gateway `/asr/ws`, SDK `VoiceApi` / `VoiceInputClient`, web UI).
- **SDK voice client**: New voice-input export with idle WebSocket reuse, audio buffering until ASR starts, and configurable connection timeouts for snappier repeated captures.
- **Mobile workspace**: Split mode is disabled on mobile and forced into chat-only view for a cleaner small-screen layout.
- **IndexedDB resilience**: Cache layer recovers from closed/reconnecting connections instead of failing mid-read/write.

### Bug Fixes

- Split-mode turn routing no longer follows stale turns or races new-session navigation; per-session turn-list scroll is preserved.
- Session composer auto-expands when content needs more room.
- Realtime protocol accepts the label domain for live label updates.

## v1.46 — 2026-06-03

- **Session split mode**: View a session side-by-side with a secondary panel, with view preferences persisted per session.
- **Realtime label sync**: Resource label assign/unassign events propagate over websockets so sidebar and pickers stay in sync across clients.
- **Resource label cache**: IndexedDB + in-memory LRU layer for resource labels enables cache-first sidebar hydration and fresher label pickers without blocking loads.
- **Sidebar label actions**: Inline label controls, clearer drag affordances, and improved collapsed flyout alignment for faster labeling workflows.

### Bug Fixes

- Stabilize session split mode when switching sessions or view modes.
- Keep label drag previews visible and avoid layout jumps on drag start.
- Disable ligatures in code text for more reliable monospaced rendering.

## v1.45 — 2026-06-03

- **Path-based labels**: Labels are addressable by hierarchical refs (`Bug`, `Area/Frontend`) end-to-end—shared `@cohub/core/labels` resolution, ref-oriented API routes, SDK helpers, and full CLI `spaces labels` management.
- **Label-aware prompts & sessions**: Attach labels when creating sessions or sending prompts (API, worker, CLI `--label`); new sessions also get automatic system source labels (channel, scheduled task, API, etc.).
- **Drag-to-label workspace**: Drag sessions and files onto sidebar labels to assign or move them, with item remove actions and a polished label sidebar/picker UX.
- **Label create-on-assign**: Attach flows can resolve missing label paths and create them when the caller has manage permission, reducing setup friction across clients.

### Bug Fixes

- Prevent iOS focus zoom on inputs by tightening the mobile font-size selector.
- Relax composer image compression so larger uploads stay usable.
- CLI multi-output generations fall back to a directory when `--output` is a single file path.

## v1.44 — 2026-06-02

- **Hierarchical labels**: Replaces space pins with nested labels, assignments for sessions/checkpoints/files, resource label pickers, and a full labels API across server, SDK, and web—existing pins migrate to a Pinned label.
- **Billing plans & redemption**: Adds plan/addon catalog, checkout and subscribe flows, redemption codes, usage records, open overages, and a richer balance details experience.
- **Faster sidebar labels**: Caches label trees and items in IndexedDB, persists expansion state, and keeps the chat sidebar denser with smoother fork-session sync.
- **Workspace polish**: Drag generation task references into chats, refined port-ready toasts, softer unread indicators, and markdown code ligatures disabled for clearer diffs.

### Bug Fixes

- Validate checkpoint space id before use
- Tighten label uniqueness and depth constraints
- Declare native TypeScript preview in protocol package

## v1.43 — 2026-06-02

- **Read-only prompts**: prompts can run with `accessMode: read_only`, limiting the agent to inspect-only tools (`read`, `ls`, `find`, `grep`); CLI exposes this via `--read-only`.
- **Session owners and participants**: sessions now track an owner `userUuid` plus participant metadata, with hydrated profiles surfaced in the sidebar.
- **Live session activity sidebar**: chat rows show participant avatars, compact activity times, and live phase previews (thinking, tools, streaming, failed, unread).
- **Job failure diagnostics**: BullMQ jobs record structured, redacted failure progress/logs across agent, sandbox, and worker task paths for faster ops debugging.

### Bug Fixes

- Render cached file tree immediately, then refresh in the background
- Preserve spaces in inline markdown code spans
- Keep a shared/open session visible even without session-list access
- Complete sandbox uploads with presigned download URLs instead of public object URLs
- Refuse bootstrap/restore into a non-empty workspace instead of wiping it
- Filter queue worker counts by Redis DB to avoid cross-env inflation

## v1.42 — 2026-06-01

- **Checkpoint v2**: New save/restore pipeline with nested git repos, object storage for large assets, and space forking from any checkpoint (web + worker).
- **Explore wall**: Native Explore view with a public-safe DTO (avatars, saves, pins, access labels) instead of leaking full space records.
- **Structured observability**: Shared JSON logger with secret redaction and trace/request correlation, wired for SLS collection across services.
- **Process termination**: Sandbox/agent now propagate bash exit reasons (`exited` / `timed_out` / `aborted`) through tool results and run-command progress.
- **Optimistic chat turns**: Tighter clientMessageId reconciliation and dedupe so sent messages stay stable across HTTP, WebSocket, and local cache.

### Bug Fixes

- Preserve dirty workspace files and nested paths when restoring checkpoints; skip system dirs and respect storage subpath mounts.
- Return 400 for invalid space config instead of failing later in provisioning.
- Create task runs before enqueue so checkpoint saves and prompts cannot drop work on queue failures.

## v1.41 — 2026-05-29

- **Filtered file view**: new `file.view.filtered` permission exposes space files while honoring `.gitignore` (and hiding `.git`), and mod mounts only need this scoped access.
- **Sandbox recovery**: agent workers subscribe to `sandbox.replacing` lifecycle events, proactively drop stale connections, and refresh WebSocket URLs when pods are replaced or the network flaps.
- **Sandbox RPC errors**: clearer user-facing failure kinds (`Sandbox is not ready` / `Sandbox connection lost`) with better infrastructure vs. tool-error classification.
- **Generation tray**: compact session generation tray with a video icon, status dots, lighter backdrop, and cleaner expand/collapse UX.

### Bug Fixes

- Strip NUL characters from message content and meta before Postgres JSON persist.
- Allow mod mount setup with filtered file view instead of requiring full `file.view`.

## v1.40 — 2026-05-28

- **Per-turn generation policy**: Constrain which multimodal models and parameters a turn may use via a shared `GenerationPolicy` protocol—enforced through API, agent sandbox env, CLI, and a tabbed Model Selector (Chat / Generation) with auto/limited modes.
- **Session & task realtime lifecycle**: Replace legacy turn progress/snapshot events with structured `session.*` and `task.*` lifecycle events, dedicated API/worker dispatch helpers, richer realtime records, and SDK subscription cleanup.
- **Live task runs cache**: Event-driven task-run cache keeps sidebar and workspace in sync on `task.created`/`task.updated`, reconciles optimistic turn IDs on request accept, and slows polling to realtime-first updates.
- **Collapsed sidebar flyouts**: Hover/focus flyout panels expose pinned items, sessions, checkpoints, cronjobs, and tasks from the compact rail without expanding the full sidebar.
- **Session generation task tray**: In-session generation jobs surface as persistent media-aware task cards so image/video/music progress stays visible while you keep working.

### Bug Fixes

- Model selector correctly renders parameter constraints and minimum-one enum selection guards.
- Generation tray collapse state stays stable across session updates.
- CLI surfaces clearer diagnostics when network fetch calls fail.

## v1.39 — 2026-05-27

- **Covas canvas workspace**: Open and edit `.covas` documents in a PixiJS workspace with drag-to-canvas cards, renderer/theme registries, inspector, and manual save.
- **Billing credits**: Integrate credit balance and usage across API, SDK, and sidebar so sessions and prompts can meter against account credits.
- **Async generations via neta SDK**: Move multimodal generation onto worker tasks and the neta generation SDK, with Gemini image and Ark video adapters plus richer CLI task feedback.
- **Workspace layout controls**: Add a collapsible left sidebar rail and preview focus mode so chat, files, and previews can expand without losing context.

### Bug Fixes

- Recover web auth from transient unauthorized responses instead of forcing a hard logout.
- Improve canvas preview resizing and text clarity, and avoid duplicate toolbar icons.
- Honor CLI JSON output and restore reliable space/auth defaults.

## v1.38 — 2026-05-26

- **Default space mods**: New spaces can ship with platform default mods pre-mounted, and the create-space flow now supports mounting extra mod spaces under `/mods/<slug>` with API/SDK/protocol support.
- **Local cross-space reads**: Agent cross-space read/query tools run locally against workspace mounts instead of round-tripping through the sandbox, cutting latency for multi-space work.
- **Extensible themes**: Theme registry plus Solarized Dark/Light, with CodeMirror and markdown styling wired through shared tokens for consistent editor and UI appearance.
- **Markdown frontmatter preview**: YAML frontmatter is parsed and rendered as a structured key/value panel above document content.
- **Faster first paint caches**: Profile and space record caches hydrate auth, sidebar, and workspace routes from local storage while remote data refreshes in the background.

### Bug Fixes

- Settle agent retry failures and fail stuck turns instead of leaving sessions hanging
- Load the current sidebar space from the URL and refresh command-palette default-space cache
- Allow underscores in mod mount slugs; polish dark-mode reading contrast

## v1.37 — 2026-05-24

- **Space avatars**: Spaces get a public profile with avatar identity, surfaced consistently in the sidebar, command palette, mentions, search, explore, and trending.
- **Inline space profile**: Edit description, upload a space avatar, and manage slug for pretty `/{username}/{slug}` URLs directly on the space workspace page; the separate settings profile route is removed.
- **Space identity API**: Space list/detail/search responses expose a normalized `publicProfile` with validated avatar URLs, and public-asset deploy config supports avatar hosting.

### Bug Fixes

- Guard sidebar loads against space-switch races so sessions, pins, checkpoints, cron jobs, and tasks no longer flash stale data from the previous space.
- Avoid clipping collapsed tool output height, and hide the ⌘K shortcut label on small mobile sidebars.

## v1.36 — 2026-05-24

- **Run Command**: Execute bash in space sandboxes from the command palette, with shared core/infra primitives, agent job processing, and live streaming output.
- **Space slugs**: Assign per-owner URL slugs so spaces resolve at `/[username]/[spaceSlug]`, with create/settings/SDK support.
- **Message & turn timing**: Persist `startedAt`, `completedAt`, and `durationMs` across protocol, DB, agent, API, and realtime, and surface durations in the UI.
- **Public avatar uploads**: Upload profile and space avatars through a dedicated public-assets pipeline (presigned storage, SDK, CLI, and polished web editors).
- **Streaming edit diffs**: Render optimistic partial diffs for edit tool input as each side streams in, removing the JSON→diff jump.

### Bug Fixes

- CLI clears the full auth session on 401 instead of only the device code
- Preserve tool timing metadata when assistant content is persisted
- Sync space env cache on space creation

## v1.35 — 2026-05-22

- **Inline profile editing**: Display name, username, and avatar URL edit in place with per-field save/cancel, skeleton loading, and a cleaner identity header—no full-form Save pass.
- **Env-aware sandbox idle TTL**: Default auto-destroy idle TTL is now 12h in prod and 10m in dev (was 48h everywhere), aligned across API, CLI, and sandbox-controller.
- **Honest authz responses**: Permission denials return 401/403 via a shared `authzDenied` helper instead of masquerading as 404; invalid tokens reject with 401.
- **Session fork tree polish**: Sidebar fork branches use clearer last-child connectors and brand-tinted guides; list refresh preserves fork cache so hierarchy does not drop.

### Bug Fixes

- Drain in-flight stream flushes before reset so assistant deltas are not lost; empty-delta flushes no longer pin the flush lock forever
- Guard Enter/shortcut handlers during IME composition (composer, renames, command palette)
- Clean stale `.git/index.lock` before worker git ops; prevent sandbox WS unhandledRejection crashes on Node 22+
- Refresh directory contents on expand; grant worker SA delete-pods RBAC in the sessions namespace

## v1.34 — 2026-05-21

- **Sandbox upload materialization**: Refactored space file uploads to support `workspace` and `sandbox_tmp` destinations, materializing files via agent `sandbox_bash` jobs instead of async worker import tasks
- **Streaming turn finalization**: Apply full content blocks from the commit event and keep the finalized streaming preview stable until reconciliation, eliminating re-stream flicker on completed generations
- **Sandbox readiness**: Warm sandbox connections asynchronously and refine tool failure handling for more reliable coding sessions

### Bug Fixes

- Allow guest access to the prompts endpoint so anonymous space visitors are not redirected to login
- Prevent completed generations from re-activating the typing animation after finalized or stale HTTP tail data

## v1.33 — 2026-05-20

- **Structured tool call details**: Chat tool calls now render tool-specific input and output views—commands, paths, ranges, edit diffs, and collapsible long content—with clearer live/partial state and mobile-friendly layout.
- **Typed sandbox RPC failures**: Sandbox WebSocket RPC errors are modeled as structured `SandboxRpcError`s (retryable, infrastructure, error code) and surfaced cleanly through bash tools and the agent session, so infrastructure failures no longer look like generic tool crashes.

### Bug Fixes

- Filewatch repair loop now runs every 5 minutes instead of every 10 seconds, cutting unnecessary repair churn.

## v1.32 — 2026-05-20

- **Sandbox lifecycle controller**: New `@cohub/sandbox-controller` package models lifecycle vs runtime health, auto-resumes stopped sandboxes on new prompts, and replaces batch reaping with per-space auto-destroy policies (idle TTL or never) exposed via API, SDK, CLI, and space settings.
- **Usernames**: Unique `@username` profiles with validation, reserved-name blocking, and conflict handling—available in settings, Explore/search context, SDK, and CLI.
- **Global space pins**: Pin spaces across the product from the command palette (`p:` filter, pin toggle, insert action) with user-scoped global pin refs.
- **Sectioned Explore**: Curated Explore sections with richer space cards—owner identity, stats, latest save hints, and sandbox status—backed by a sectioned API and cache refresh.

### Bug Fixes

- Apply finalized stream content immediately so the UI does not stall waiting on slow turn hydrate
- Recover session refresh correctly for in-flight turns and stop rejecting prompts when a sandbox is still recovering
- Improve iOS input zoom / mobile form ergonomics and expand final tool-call results by default

## v1.31 — 2026-05-19

- **Session link mentions**: Paste space or session URLs in the composer and they resolve into labeled `@[space/session]` mentions with cache-aware label lookup.
- **Space access payload**: Space GET returns resolved `access` (role + permission list); session sharing is gated on `member.manage` instead of ad-hoc checks.
- **Space settings polish**: Copy member UUIDs, auto-copy invite links on create, and set/edit mod mount slugs without leaving settings.
- **Image MIME hardening**: Composer and agent only treat JPEG/PNG/GIF/WebP as images, with clear fallbacks for unsupported types.
- **Cross-space query path policy**: Agent query tools reject paths that escape `/workspace` when reading another space.

### Bug Fixes

- Model selector keyboard navigation, shortcut propagation, and selected-row highlight aligned with hover.
- API and CLI surface cleaner error messages; SDK extracts nested `message` fields; optional `COHUB_DEBUG_ERRORS` adds status/code/requestId detail.

## v1.30 — 2026-05-18

- **Space Mods**: Mount other spaces into a workspace under `/mods`, with API, SDK, CLI, and settings UI; sandbox restarts when mods change.
- **Chat file references**: Attach arbitrary files and folders in the composer via drag-and-drop, paste, or picker; uploads go through a shared space-upload pipeline with progress.
- **End-to-end request tracing**: Propagate `requestId`/trace context across API, queues, and agent turns, with stream telemetry and filtering of noisy realtime Redis spans.
- **Session domain services**: Extract session prompt/turn orchestration into a shared service layer; turns start as `queued` with clearer lifecycle tracking.
- **Stream snapshot throttling**: Coalesce agent stream snapshot writes to Redis to cut write pressure during high-frequency streaming.

### Bug Fixes

- Fail interrupted sandbox tool calls instead of leaving them hanging.
- Collapse the expanded composer after send.
- Harden prompt scheduling validation and error responses.

## v1.29 — 2026-05-18

- **In-browser debugger**: New `@neta-art/cohub/debugger` instruments console, fetch/XHR, EventSource, and WebSocket traffic with ring-buffered capture, redaction, and HAR export; the web app auto-starts it and can download a debug bundle from the user menu.
- **ContentBlock normalizer**: Shared `@cohub/core/content/normalize` canonicalizes image aliases and nested tool_result content across prompt submit and the agent pipeline, with safe-mode invalid-block reporting.
- **Multimodal image path**: Agent runtime now converts and preserves base64/URL image blocks end-to-end when building LLM user and tool-result messages.
- **Turn recovery hardening**: Locked/busy turns requeue with exponential backoff; queued-turn drain runs after lock release so abort/steer and completed turns no longer stall the session queue.
- **Command palette timestamps**: Results show compact local timestamps (time today, date otherwise) with full timezone tooltips.

### Bug Fixes

- Direct shell turns honor parent abort signals so cancellations stop in-flight commands.
- Sandbox bash streaming skips non-string chunks and keeps execution-token redaction intact.
- Removed the running tool-call side rail indicator to reduce visual noise.

## v1.28 — 2026-05-17

- **Sandbox connection pool**: Replaced acquire/release leases with `ensureSandboxConnection`, LRU pruning, pending-request-aware idle eviction, and deduplicated WS URL resolution for more reliable multi-space sandbox access.
- **Cross-space tool routing**: Space-aware tools now always establish a sandbox connection for the target space and preserve full tool execution context when switching spaces.
- **TypeScript builds via tsgo**: Switched package builds to the native TypeScript compiler preview for faster typechecking and builds.

### Bug Fixes

- Sandbox pool no longer disconnects spaces that still have in-flight RPC requests during capacity pruning or idle eviction.

## v1.27 — 2026-05-17

- **Core package consolidation**: Introduce `@cohub/core` and `@cohub/infra`, fold permissions, session prompts, FS CDN policy, tracing, and queue helpers into shared packages, and tighten protocol boundaries across realtime, gateway, and sandbox contracts.
- **Direct shell commands**: Run `!command` turns without an LLM round-trip, with chunked bash output streaming and execution-auth injection into the sandbox environment.
- **Streaming tool call UI**: Simplify and polish in-progress tool call rendering for clearer live feedback.
- **Sidebar fork ordering**: Improve how forked sessions are ordered in the sidebar for more predictable navigation.

### Bug Fixes

- Restore the direct shell command execution path and stream bash output by chunks.
- Inject execution auth into bash env and `ENV=dev` into dev sandbox pods.
- Break session-content circular dependencies and avoid eager prompt dependency initialization.

## v1.26 — 2026-05-16

- **BullMQ agent runtime**: Replaced Redis list turn dispatch with a BullMQ-backed agent queue, batch turn claiming/merging, session locks, abort pub/sub, and sandbox connection pooling for more reliable concurrent execution.
- **Space FS CDN cache**: Warm media and large workspace files to object storage with a dedicated system worker, so reads can return CDN URLs instead of proxying every byte through the API.
- **Shared platform packages**: Extracted `@cohub/db-schema`, `@cohub/permissions`, and `@cohub/bullmq-ops`, unified package naming under `@cohub/*`, and split workers into user/system deployments with queue snapshots and Prometheus metrics.
- **Space file APIs & CLI**: Added batch file read with preparing/CDN delivery states, plus a CLI space file upload command for multi-file and directory uploads.
- **Session forks in sidebar**: Surface forked sessions in the web sidebar, with command palette polish and clearer token usage including cached input.

### Bug Fixes

- Recover stale active agent turns and detect stale session handles via file signature.
- Avoid CDN CORS and disposition issues on space file downloads while keeping embedded asset URLs stable.
- Fix model selector keyboard navigation.

## v1.25 — 2026-05-13

- **Space mentions**: Type `@` in the composer to reference other spaces with local-first search, owner avatars, interactive chips in chat, and automatic conversion of pasted space URLs.
- **Command palette & search**: Typed resource filters, default recents, and server-side scoped search with membership ranking, public space visibility, and owner profile enrichment.
- **CLI device login**: Logto device authorization flow for browser-based `cohub auth login` without pasting tokens by hand.
- **Usage insights**: Space overview replaces the heatmap with cost and token breakdowns, daily trend charts, and 7 / 30 / 90 day ranges.
- **Theme system**: Semantic tokens moved into dedicated light/dark theme modules for safer, theme-consistent UI styling.

### Bug Fixes

- Preserve file tree expansion state after saving files
- Update the URL when jumping to a session turn
- Normalize `!` shell commands in prompt templates with leading whitespace
- Close slash menu after selecting a command; keep model selector search focus visible

## v1.24 — 2026-05-13

- **Slash command menu**: Rebuilt as a dedicated `SlashCommandMenu` with ranked filtering, category groups, loading/empty states, and richer keyboard navigation on desktop and mobile.
- **Model selector shortcuts**: Open the model picker with ⌘/Ctrl+Shift+M, navigate with arrows or Ctrl+N/P, and discover the flow from the help panel.
- **CLI expansion**: Add `cohub search`, top-level `prompt`, turn inspection under sessions, multimodal listing via `models ls --model-type multimodal`, and sandbox self-update for `@neta-art/cohub-cli`.
- **Prompt templates runtime**: Share prompt config through `@cohub/config-runtime/prompts`, load from `.agents/prompts`, and publish Redis caches on platform/user checkpoint saves.

### Bug Fixes

- Preserve nested code fences inside markdown/md/mdx blocks while rendering.
- Hide code copy controls during live streaming to stop flicker.
- Allow shifted letter shortcuts only outside editable fields so composer typing stays intact.

## v1.23 — 2026-05-13

- **Multimodal generations**: Declaration-driven generation API across protocol, API, SDK, CLI, and config runtime — YAML models, content blocks (text/image/video/audio), OpenAI images adapter, and `cohub generate` / `cohub generations ls`.
- **Vim session navigation**: Session timeline keys for scroll (`j`/`k`), turn jump (`Shift+J`/`Shift+K`), top/bottom (`gg`/`G`), and composer focus (`i`), plus global new chat (`⌘O` / `Ctrl+O`).
- **Help panel**: Global `?` cheat sheet for shortcuts across search, sessions, composer, and files, with sidebar entry.
- **Command palette ranking**: Prefer spaces over sessions and turns in search and palette scoring, with clearer type marks and active-result scrolling.
- **Mobile prompt templates**: Touch-friendly template picker and broader prompt suggestion support on small screens.

### Bug Fixes

- Keep file tree action menus above hovered siblings
- Stop generation no longer triggers form submit in the composer
- Reduce sidebar item action whitespace on hover

## v1.22 — 2026-05-12

- **Command palette**: ⌘K / Ctrl+K multi-source search across spaces, sessions, and messages—local IndexedDB results merge with remote pg_trgm fuzzy search, ranked by text match, recency, and type priority
- **Live streaming markdown**: incomplete assistant output is repaired with remend and rendered as a single cached surface for smoother, less jumpy stream UI
- **Session generation stream client**: SDK `SessionGenerationStreamClient` normalizes generation events; web realtime path is simplified onto the shared client
- **Agent async I/O**: session manager and system prompt builder move from sync fs to async I/O with serialized writes, parallel context loading, and safer disposal flushes
- **Agent stream performance**: deferred content projection, leaner assistant stream state, and quieter tracing/logging cut runtime overhead

### Bug Fixes

- Independent stream reducer state per `session.subscribeGeneration` subscription
- Safer post-send recovery timing and streaming markdown surface caching

## v1.21 — 2026-05-12

- **Cross-space query tools**: Agents can `read`, `ls`, `find`, and `grep` other spaces via optional `space_id`, with permission checks, workspace readiness gates, and path sandboxing backed by `fd`/`rg` in the agent image.
- **Incremental streaming markdown**: Chat renders a stable HTML prefix plus a live word-by-word tail with caret animation, cutting reparse cost and reducing layout thrash during long replies.
- **Stream-order content merge**: Final assistant messages are reordered to match the live stream (including `toolCall` → `tool_use` normalization), so persisted history matches what users saw.
- **Hybrid query tool routing**: Sandbox tools and cross-space tools share one schema; requests without `space_id` stay local, while remote spaces go through cached access checks.

### Bug Fixes

- Keep the live streaming preview as the source of truth for the active turn instead of flashing committed content mid-stream
- Dedupe session recovery requests on the workspace page
- Respect prefers-reduced-motion for streaming word and caret animations

## v1.20 — 2026-05-11

- **Segment-based session forks**: Redesign fork lineage around dedicated `session_forks` and `session_turn_segments` tables so branch trees, turn visibility, and anchor resolution stay efficient across deep forks (with async agent `fork_session` handling).
- **Direct shell commands**: Prefix input with `!` to run shell turns that bypass the LLM, stream results in-session, and render as lightweight terminal-style blocks in the web UI.
- **Normalized generation stream (SDK)**: Add `SessionGenerationStreamClient` / `session.subscribeGeneration()` to fold snapshots, patches, commits, and turn finalization into stable semantic events for product UIs.
- **Generation state reconciliation**: Unify web generation recovery via `syncGenerationStateFromTail`, with stale-response guards and running-turn resume from session tail data.

### Bug Fixes

- Restore fork button by syncing `agentSessionEntryId` into `session_turns` meta on finalize
- Prevent shell-command session-operation deadlocks and handle empty assistant responses
- Fix `/api/prompts` always failing auth by routing PromptsApi through HttpTransport

## v1.19 — 2026-05-10

- **Live tool output**: Stream partial tool execution results (e.g. bash stdout) to the UI in real time, with throttled updates and an execution-tail preview while tools run.
- **Phase-aware tool calls**: Distinguish drafting vs executing phases with animated rail, breathing status, input preview, and tool-specific activity labels (respecting reduced motion).
- **Realtime architecture**: Replace Redis stream consumers with pub/sub channels and internal HTTP APIs across agent, API, gateway, and worker—simpler topology, no consumer-group coordination.
- **Drafting preview**: Smarter field scoring and change tracking for clearer in-progress tool input display.
- **Sandbox file watch**: Broader ignore patterns for VCS, dependencies, build outputs, and nested cache dirs, with scoped path matching.

### Bug Fixes

- Restore and enrich running-turn stream snapshots with intermediate metadata and fallback tool-call parsing.
- Stabilize block identity matching across patches and snapshots; force replace ops for partialResult string patches.
- Stabilize streaming markdown fences; show last non-empty line in execution tail instead of full collapsed text.

## v1.18 — 2026-05-09

- **Unified space prompt scheduling**: One `POST /spaces/:id/prompt` path covers immediate send plus delay, at, and cron schedules (`CreateSpacePromptInput` / `clientMessageId`), with SDK `space.prompt()`, CLI spaces commands, and a shared `submitSessionPrompt` core for web, API, channels, and workers.
- **Message-scoped patch streams**: `getSessionTurnPatchStreamKey()` isolates session turn patches by message identity (`sourceMessageId`, `messageOrdinal`), so concurrent and reconnecting streams no longer cross-apply compact frames.
- **Text composer attachments**: Drop text and code files into the chat composer alongside images, with preview cards and consistent attachment baselines.
- **Stop generation control**: Abort is separated from interrupt on session turns, with stop-generation UI and clearer agent abort feedback.
- **Trending & jobs polish**: Trending shows user profiles with a tighter mobile layout; scheduled-job detail is redesigned and the legacy jobs page is removed.

### Bug Fixes

- Websocket compact stream buffering after reconnecting into an active turn from a snapshot
- Hardened markdown rendering and dark-mode code theme
- Space env validation returns sanitized 400 errors instead of opaque failures

## v1.17 — 2026-05-08

- **Deep session stream patches**: Streaming now diffs full content blocks (including nested tool_use fields) instead of only text/thinking appends, with server-side delta extraction and a matching SDK reducer for arbitrary block subpaths.
- **Space member profiles**: Members API joins user profiles so settings show display names and avatars instead of raw user IDs.
- **Markdown list polish**: Nested lists, task checkboxes, and list-item paragraphs render with clearer hierarchy and spacing.

### Bug Fixes

- Turn rail now prefers freshly loaded turn status when merging index and session state.

## v1.16 — 2026-05-08

- **Streaming markdown pipeline**: Split rendering into MarkdownSurface + MarkdownView, replaced Tailwind prose with a custom theme-aware stylesheet, added render caching and throttled streaming updates for smoother chat output.
- **Session turn rail**: Merged the session scroll rail with turn markers positioned by turn range so long chats are easier to scan and jump through.
- **File sidebar actions**: Collapsed tree and header controls into dropdown menus with clearer pin/upload/create actions and improved pane resize UX.
- **Space upload reliability**: Wired worker OSS config for presigned uploads, fixed virtual-hosted URLs and CORS, and preserved uploaded folder hierarchy including dotfiles.
- **Profile & settings polish**: Improved settings navigation and profile layout, and fixed Logto Management API profile updates end to end.

### Bug Fixes

- Reduced sandbox recovery false positives
- Fixed mobile drawer swipe-to-close
- Aligned turn rail markers with the scroll thumb range
- Switched markdown code highlighting with app light/dark theme

## v1.15 — 2026-05-08

- **Presigned space uploads**: Two-phase S3 upload with async worker import, folder drag-drop, and live progress across API, worker, SDK, and web.
- **User profiles**: Logto-synced profiles with editable display name and avatar, plus a unified `authorProfile` model across protocol, realtime, and UI.
- **Inline port preview**: Preview running space ports directly in the workspace pane without leaving the session.
- **Turn rail & context usage**: DOM-accurate turn markers with older/newer pagination, plus color-coded context usage in the composer and message footer.
- **Code block copy**: One-click copy buttons on markdown code blocks for faster reuse of agent output.

### Bug Fixes

- Recover session stream snapshots after reconnects and load full session state on route switches
- Stop API request storms on failures with backoff, single-flight sign-in, and offline-aware WebSocket reconnect
- Fix sidebar session pagination and show workspace-relative tool file paths

## v1.14 — 2026-05-07

- **Space invites restored**: create, copy, and revoke invite links with role, TTL, and max-use controls in space settings; add members by UUID and manage roles in place
- **Clickable tool file paths**: read/write/edit tool calls surface file paths that open directly in the workspace
- **Authenticated space file downloads**: SDK and web download private files via authenticated blob URLs instead of bare API links
- **Ports panel polish**: rename Preview to Ports and collapse status into a status dot with hover tooltip
- **Monorepo alias resolution**: move protocol/SDK subpath aliases into SvelteKit config with correct specificity order so bare package names no longer shadow subpaths

### Bug Fixes

- Keep the member remove action visible in space settings
- Download private space files through the SDK transport

## v1.13 — 2026-05-06

- **Live sandbox previews**: Sandbox now watches public ports and streams `space.ports.changed` end-to-end so the workspace shows Live/Idle preview status with openable public URLs.
- **User Rules**: New Settings → User Rules surface for publishing personal `AGENTS.md` from your config Space, with API read access and automatic inclusion in chat system context.
- **Stream snapshot v2**: Reconnect recovery upgrades to full `session.turn.snapshot` payloads (current + intermediate messages), with SDK-side ordered patch buffering for out-of-order frames.
- **Space navigation**: Recent Spaces become a multi-entry local history, the space picker splits Recent vs All, and New Chat is elevated as a primary action.

### Bug Fixes

- Empty git repo imports no longer fail when creating a space from a repository without HEAD
- Unread badges track `lastMessageId` instead of turn id, fixing mismatched unread state
- Avoid repeated empty turn-index fetches; hide the mobile turn list control on desktop

## v1.12 — 2026-05-05

- **Live multi-message streaming**: track `messageId` / `messageOrdinal` across agent → API → gateway → web so intermediate assistant messages render live in the process card, with user-scoped generation persistence and safer turn/message boundary handling.
- **Turn navigator**: paginated turn index API plus desktop `TurnRail` and mobile `TurnBottomSheet` for jump-to-turn browsing of long sessions.
- **Sandbox self-healing**: detect stale/critical mount failures, recover via API with distributed lock and smoke checks (kubernetes Exec API), expose health + manual force-recover in Space settings, and add sandbox readiness/liveness probes.
- **Faster space open**: `space_records` IndexedDB + memory LRU cache seeds workspace state immediately while refreshing in the background; session loading is decoupled from space load.
- **Safer config publish**: worker replaces backup+rename with in-place directory sync to avoid cross-filesystem rename failures and reduce publish risk.

### Bug Fixes

- Multi-message streaming transitions, turn switches mid-stream, and duplicate final/process-card messages
- IndexedDB DataCloneError from unsanitized cache writes; markdown render race during streaming
- API pods/exec RBAC and clearer sandbox recovery error logging

## v1.11 — 2026-05-01

- **Explore spaces**: platform-curated explore feed surfaces discoverable spaces with checkpoint previews, pin counts, and sandbox status, backed by Redis-cached config and a new SDK API.
- **Pinned resources**: pin sessions, checkpoints, and files per space (rank-ordered, capped at 10) with sidebar actions, marks API, and space.pin permission.
- **IndexedDB cache layer**: replace localStorage list caches with repository-backed IndexedDB stores (session lists, turns, space FS), memory LRU, cross-tab BroadcastChannel sync, and periodic cleanup for faster first paint and multi-tab consistency.
- **Unified resource actions**: consolidate sidebar and workspace item actions into consistent dropdown menus, with improved pin flows and mobile long-press / insert gestures.

### Bug Fixes

- Normalize gateway channel commands and turns across Discord and Feishu providers
- Default markdown files to preview mode
- Remove PageHeader right-section overflow and width constraints

## v1.10 — 2026-04-30

- **Turn-based session architecture**: Rebuilt chat rendering from message-centric to turn-level model, with `turn.updated` / `turn.finalized` realtime events, on-demand intermediate tool details, and a cleaner SDK turns client.
- **Optimistic turn rendering**: Show a provisional running turn immediately on send, then swap in the real turn id on success for snappier session UX.
- **Feishu channel commands**: Add session commands, reply to inbound Feishu messages, expand docs/images in the gateway, and normalize document URLs.
- **Unified tool-call UI**: Extract shared tool-call formatting and block-ordered message content flow so process cards, intermediate bubbles, and assistant replies render consistently.

### Bug Fixes

- Stop markdown render callback loops that could thrash the chat timeline.
- Avoid duplicate intermediate tool-call entries during streaming turns.

## v1.9 — 2026-04-30

- **Patch-based session streaming**: Replace full-content turn progress with sequenced `session.turn.patch` ops (append/replace/merge/remove), plus a client `SessionPatchReducer` for efficient incremental updates.
- **Compact WebSocket frames**: Opt-in `session.compact_stream.v1` capability ships lightweight delta/patch frames over the wire, cutting realtime bandwidth for long streams.
- **Stream resume after reconnect**: Redis-backed session stream snapshots restore in-flight assistant output on auth/reconnect and page refresh, so generation continues without a blank turn.
- **Intermediate assistant messages**: Patch sequencing now tracks `assistant_intermediate` messages alongside finals for multi-step turns.
- **Sandbox NFS self-heal**: Auto-recover stale mounts when NFS file-handle errors occur, improving sandbox filesystem reliability.

## v1.8 — 2026-04-30

- **Optional auth for RBAC routes**: introduce `getOptionalAuth` so session, space, file, task, and usage APIs can authorize via policies—including anonymous access—instead of requiring a signed-in user up front.
- **Realtime final-turn consolidation**: remove `session.turn.final` and treat assistant finals through `session.message.persisted`, with a leaner `RealtimeMessageRecord` payload and SDK `turn.final` mapped from `assistant_final` messages.
- **Readable-user ID caching**: short-TTL cache for space membership lookups cuts DB load on realtime fan-out.
- **Config mount path alignment**: publish and sandbox mounts use `PLATFORM_CONFIG_ROOT` / `CONFIGS_SUBPATH` so platform and user agent configs resolve correctly.

### Bug Fixes

- Correct session turns pagination (exclusive older cursor, nextCursor, and page slice) and add a backfill script for missing turns.
- Complete chat generation and auto-scroll only on terminal assistant messages (`assistant_final` / `assistant_error`), not every assistant persist.

## v1.7 — 2026-04-29

- **Session turns**: First-class turn tracking for space sessions—lifecycle status, intent, sequence, usage/tool summaries, and cursor-paginated turn APIs
- **Turn object storage**: Persist intermediate messages and tool-call details in S3 with signed/CDN access for full turn inspection
- **Turn interrupt**: Agents auto-interrupt a running turn when a new one arrives; internal interrupt endpoint for explicit cancellation
- **Tool input summaries**: Smarter tool-input summarization with truncation tracking for leaner turn records

### Bug Fixes

- Prefix cost displays with $ and drop duplicate cost under space usage
- Accept short user IDs when publishing worker config

## v1.6 — 2026-04-29

- **Realtime filesystem sync**: Sandbox fsnotify watcher streams debounced, batched changes through agent/API/worker into space WebSockets, so web file trees, open editors, and previews stay live across collaborative edits and bootstrap.
- **Cursor-paginated sessions**: Space session lists use limit/cursor pagination (default 20) across API, SDK, and web sidebar Load more, avoiding unbounded first-load fetches.
- **Environment-aware SDK & CLI**: Clients resolve prod/dev API and WebSocket endpoints by default (`ENV=dev` or `env: "dev"`), with per-environment CLI auth tokens.
- **Usage cost breakdown**: Space usage and trending surfaces expose input/output/cache cost totals alongside token counts for clearer spend visibility.
- **Generation-aware unread state**: Session generation tracking (`isGenerating`) and smarter viewed-message anchors keep unread badges accurate while turns stream.

### Bug Fixes

- Refresh space env before each agent turn so sandbox processes see latest variables
- Route worker shared caches and space events through app Redis while keeping BullMQ on its queue Redis
- Make dialog overlays cover the full viewport on mobile
- Parse env import values that contain `=` correctly
- Persist session-list pagination state across sidebar reloads
- Sanitize sandbox child process env and stop large-scale sandbox rollout hangs

## v1.5 — 2026-04-28

- **Local JWT auth**: new `@cohub/auth` package verifies Logto access tokens via JWKS in API and gateway, removing remote `/v1/user` and `/api/me` auth round-trips.
- **Resilient web auth**: centralized auth store with refresh-token fallback, redirect-preserving 401 handling, and an auth-ready gate so UI no longer flashes unauthenticated state.
- **Shared models runtime**: `@cohub/config-runtime` unifies models config parse/merge/cache across agent, API, and worker, with Redis-backed platform + per-user overlays.
- **Space env import**: paste `.env` content in the space workspace to bulk-create or overwrite environment variables.

### Bug Fixes

- Unauthenticated `/api/models` requests now return 401 instead of 502.

## v1.4 — 2026-04-28

- **Space invite links**: Hosts can create shareable invitation links with role pre-binding, configurable TTL, and usage limits. Includes a dedicated accept page, revoke/copy controls in Members, and full SDK + API coverage backed by Redis tokens with optimistic locking.
- **Space env management UI**: Manage space environment variables directly from the workspace settings surface via new SDK env APIs.
- **Drizzle query tracing**: `@cohub/tracing` instruments Drizzle ORM so API and Worker DB queries emit spans with SQL, operation type, and duration.
- **Agent reliability hardening**: Replace fire-and-forget async paths with error-safe schedulers, hook guards, Redis listener rejection handling, and process-level `unhandledRejection` / `uncaughtExceptionMonitor` handlers.

### Bug Fixes

- Feishu image pipeline now uploads outbound images and correctly extracts inbound image keys
- Channel binding reuses alive gateway nodes and applies config/routing updates atomically via Redis MULTI

## v1.3 — 2026-04-28

- **Cohub CLI**: new `@neta-art/cohub-cli` for spaces, channels, sessions, tasks, cron jobs, models, and auth from the terminal
- **Sandbox public network**: publish sandbox ports 3000/5173 via Kubernetes Gateway API HTTPRoutes on cohub.run
- **Hot-reload space env**: manage environment variables over a REST API without restarting the sandbox pod
- **Space invitations**: host-issued invite links with role, TTL, and usage limits
- **Chat & agent UX**: message summary/detail loading, intermediate states, drag sessions into input, and automatic retry on transient agent errors

### Bug Fixes

- Feishu gateway: parse text JSON, download images, and split posts into multiple content blocks
- Worker: fix config-publish EACCES on backup cleanup and unique-constraint conflicts on checkpoint save
- Sandbox: redirect package-manager global installs to the node user home

## v1.2 — 2026-04-27

- **Space file uploads**: drag-and-drop or toolbar uploads into the space filesystem, with a non-blocking progress pane, multipart API, and SDK `files.upload` support.
- **Prompt-scoped execution auth**: short-lived grants bind agent bash tools to the initiating prompt, space, and actor, with hardened validation and session cleanup.
- **Streaming steer queue**: steer inputs are batched while a session is streaming, then drained safely instead of racing the active turn.
- **Session generation architecture**: web generation state, realtime adapter, and recovery coordinator are split into focused modules with more reliable bootstrap and reconnect sync.
- **Agent OTEL redesign**: turn, LLM, and tool spans are restructured for clearer, lower-noise traces across agent runtime paths.

### Bug Fixes

- Stabilize session recovery across space switches and reconnect races
- Render user messages as plain text to avoid accidental markdown parsing
- Fallback signed_in_user permissions to anonymous_user when the role is not configured
- Handle empty-repo checkpoint saves when HEAD does not exist

## v1.1 — 2026-04-27

- **Prompt templates**: Layered plan/review/summarize templates with API, SDK, and composer UI support.
- **Session rename**: Inline title editing from the header, desktop context menu, and mobile action sheet, with instant sidebar cache updates.
- **File path drag-and-drop**: Drag file tree nodes into the chat composer to insert markdown path snippets at the cursor.
- **Distributed tracing**: Shared `@cohub/tracing` OpenTelemetry package with end-to-end propagation across gateway, API, agent, and worker, including LLM, tool, and sandbox RPC spans (ARMS-ready).
- **Owner-scoped user config**: Load and publish per-owner agent configuration into sessions and sandboxes.

### Bug Fixes

- Preserve assistant stream block order via stable `streamIndex` identity across progress, final, and persisted payloads.
- Allow empty-diff checkpoint saves and push via a dedicated `cohub` remote instead of swapping origin.
- Fix usage route 404 by reading parent route params; accept both standard and short UUIDs for agent userId validation.

## v0.10 — 2026-04-26

- **Space usage API**: New authenticated `GET /spaces/:id/usage` endpoint returns hourly token, cache, cost, and request stats with summary aggregation; exposed via SDK `space.usage` and rendered as a token heatmap on the space detail page.
- **Immutable assistant stream state**: Agent streaming is extracted into a dedicated pure state machine that applies text/thinking/tool deltas immutably and projects content blocks, with unit and integration coverage.
- **Session scroll reliability**: Scroll-to-bottom is always available with unread-aware state, multi-frame bottom restoration, and composer-height-aware positioning for stable timeline jumps.
- **Agent & gateway resilience**: On startup, stale processing-queue messages are recovered into a bounded dead-letter queue; gateway heartbeats prune expired nodes with a shared TTL.
- **API query efficiency**: Session permission checks, channel binding, space list sandbox status, and session forking move from N+1 patterns to batched queries; empty/new sessions skip unnecessary message fetches.

### Bug Fixes

- Correct user attribution for message persistence, token usage, and trending spaces; propagate actor user id through web session prompts
- Close and ignore stale sandbox websocket connections so reconnects no longer leak or mis-fire disconnect hooks
- Reset tool blocks when a new streaming preview starts; strip the correct sentinel row in message pagination

## v0.9 — 2026-04-24

- **Cohub session runtime**: Replaced the pi-coding-agent stack with a first-party agent runtime—session manager, model registry, system prompt builder, and inlined tools—so agent execution is owned end-to-end.
- **Layered protocol & public SDK**: Split `@cohub/protocol` into core/model/realtime/gateway/fs/task subpaths, introduced `gateway-contract`, and shipped a business-oriented `@cohub/sdk` client API for co-creation integrations.
- **Local-first list & file caches**: Added a reusable localStorage list-cache factory with TTL, inflight dedupe, and cross-tab sync; session, space, and file-tree caches make sidebar and workspace loads feel instant while still reconciling in the background.
- **Workspace & sharing UX**: Inline file panel with Source/Preview toggle, message meta bar (time/model/tokens/copy), image zoom with drag-to-pan, WebSocket reconnect status and tail reconcile, Maker role for signed-in collaborators, and a public Trending leaderboard.
- **Sandbox process lifecycle**: tini as PID 1, process-group isolation, graceful SIGTERM→SIGKILL, and zombie self-heal with heartbeat process/health stats for more reliable long-running sandboxes.

### Bug Fixes

- Streaming tool calls and process expansion no longer drop mid-turn; preview collapse waits for the next progress event.
- Mobile tables, code blocks, space switcher, and model selector layout/scroll issues.
- Agent tool_result content no longer duplicates when structured arrays are handled.
- Session cache update handler infinite loop under rapid reconnects.

## v0.8 — 2026-04-23

- **Role-based access control**: Replace flat read/write permissions with a host/maker/guest RBAC model, fine-grained permission checks, space members and public access policies across API, SDK, and web
- **Shared session access**: Anonymous and limited users with session-level access get minimal space info and a stripped workspace UI instead of hard failures
- **Token usage stats**: Aggregate token usage into hourly stats for usage analytics
- **Sandbox capacity**: Raise sandbox CPU limit to 2 and restart failed pods with OnFailure policy

### Bug Fixes

- WebSocket clients auto-reconnect on 4001 token expiry even while still connecting
- Checkpoint saves set git user identity so commits succeed in containers
- Skip Drizzle v2 migrate when the schema is already healthy to avoid relation-exists failures

## v0.7 — 2026-04-23

- **@cohub/sdk**: New typed client package with modular APIs, transport, and realtime WebSocket — web fully migrated off local API helpers
- **Realtime chat updates**: WebSocket-driven session events keep the UI in sync without polling
- **Space rename**: PATCH rename API plus inline title editing on the workspace page
- **Private git bootstrap**: Create spaces from authenticated repos via `X-Git-Token` (GitHub, GitLab, Gitea)
- **Checkpoint spaces via Gitea fork**: Space creation from saves uses fork → rename instead of clone-and-push, preserving history and parent linkage

### Bug Fixes

- Deduplicate streaming and tool_call/tool_result content so assistant turns persist and render once
- Raise sandbox WebSocket ReadLimit to 50MB for large payloads
- Align task run id with jobId so task lookup no longer 404s
- Push full history on public repo import; set git safe.directory on all worker git commands

## v0.6 — 2026-04-22

- **Space domain model**: Replaces Runtime/Workspace with Space + Checkpoint as the core co-creation model, backed by a v2 schema, modular `/spaces` APIs, and full terminology migration across API, agent, worker, gateway, and web.
- **Agent / sandbox split**: Introduces a Go sandbox executor with WebSocket RPC as the execution plane; the agent becomes a pure control plane that dials the sandbox, with reconcile-based provisioning and image tracking.
- **Realtime WebSocket fabric**: Replaces per-space SSE with a global output stream, Redis Pub/Sub fan-out, and a typed realtime envelope protocol across gateway, API, and web.
- **Optimistic chat & streaming**: Adds pending-message send/reconcile, server sequence ordering, and anchor-based stream tracking for snappier, race-resistant session timelines.
- **Checkpoint bootstrap & workspace shell**: Create spaces from blank, git, or checkpoint; dedicated checkpoint/cronjob/task-run pages under a unified space shell with redesigned sidebar and settings.

### Bug Fixes

- Chat auto-scroll, composer overlap, and duplicate streaming renders during live turns
- Model selection not applied over the WebSocket inbound path
- Sandbox WebSocket reconnect loops and agent↔sandbox connectivity (POD_IP reporting)
- Dark/light theme FOUC and right-sidebar file preview not opening

## v0.5 — 2026-04-16

- **Runtime filesystem**: browse, view, edit, create, delete, and move workspace files in-runtime with a CodeMirror editor, recursive file tree, and resizable collapsible sidebars.
- **Collaborators & permissions**: invite collaborators with grantee-level access control, permission icons in settings, and multi-user sender attribution on chat messages.
- **Jobs & scheduling**: new Jobs page for cron and one-time tasks, soft-deleted cron jobs, agent-guided task creation, and a worker `send_message` task for automated deliveries.
- **Feishu channels**: first-class Feishu gateway provider with outbound rendering and a dedicated channel creation flow with per-provider setup guidance.
- **Chat UX**: ProcessCard groups intermediate assistant steps during streaming; mobile right drawer with refined swipe gestures; resizable app sidebars and multi-stage Docker builds on Node 24.

### Bug Fixes

- Prevent IME Enter from sending mid-composition; fix wake-runtime race with terminating pods; preserve process-card grouping and streaming message order; correct runtime collaborator write permissions.

## v0.4 — 2026-04-13

- **Runtime & session sharing**: Resource-level permissions with a redesigned share modal, canRead auth, and anonymous access to public runtimes/sessions.
- **Chat stack upgrade**: Paginated history with IndexedDB cache, image attachments, global media lightbox, Shiki code highlighting, and per-session model selection from a live catalog.
- **Session-scoped realtime**: Independent SSE streams per session with heartbeats, client reconnection, ordered message persistence, and unthrottled agent streaming for smoother timelines.
- **Task worker platform**: New BullMQ-backed worker service with task protocol, enqueue APIs, and deploy/CI pipelines for background and scheduled work.
- **Mobile-first shell & PWA**: Responsive layouts, swipeable sidebar drawer, centralized auth/runtime stores, and installable PWA support; runtime status now lives in the DB as the single source of truth.

### Bug Fixes

- Preserve chat scroll position across session switches and avoid blank timelines on turn end
- Correct streaming tool-call interleaving and harden message persistence reliability
- Prevent sidebar/settings request storms and keep shared runtimes stable across list refreshes

## v0.3 — 2026-04-06

- **Design system refresh**: Cohesive dark-first UI with OKLCH semantic tokens, dark/light/system themes, Instrument Sans + JetBrains Mono, denser list layouts, and a unified settings surface.
- **Real-time session streaming**: Replace message polling with authenticated SSE; page-level reconnecting stream cuts chat update latency from ~1s to under 100ms and streams thinking/tool calls live.
- **Protocol simplification**: Remove the OpenAI-style Responses API; unify on Anthropic-style ContentBlock (`tool_use`/`tool_result`, inline tools) and POST `/sessions/:id/messages` plus runtime event streams.
- **SSH key management**: Settings UI and API for user SSH public keys so Gitea push access can be managed end-to-end.
- **Faster workspace clone**: Agent git init uses shallow clone and parallel checkout, roughly halving NFS-backed workspace setup time.

### Bug Fixes

- Resolve Discord mention IDs to readable names in inbound messages
- Keep runtime detail status in sync with live polling
- Add gateway `/readyz` readiness probe and fix StatefulSet deploy via pod deletion
- Separate Logto auth endpoints/resources for dev vs prod

## v0.2 — 2026-04-02

- **Logto authentication**: Replaced local token auth with Logto SSO, async access tokens, and per-page auth guards instead of a global layout gate.
- **Non-blocking agent runtime**: Reworked the supervisor to fire-and-forget Redis inputs with explicit ack/reject, so multiple sessions can run in parallel and mid-stream messages use steer instead of blocking prompt.
- **Session source tracking**: Added a `source` field that records where a session came from (web, Discord DM, guild channel, or thread) and surfaces it in the session list.
- **Chat UX polish**: Auto-title sessions from the first message, collapsible thinking blocks, scroll-to-bottom control, and Enter-to-send / Shift+Enter newline in the composer.

### Bug Fixes

- Persist multi-turn agent messages correctly across the full agent loop
- Raise runtime provisioning wait timeout from 30s to 60s
- Keep chat input visible with proper session tab flex layout
- Hide thinking from final Discord replies while keeping a quieter collapsible view on web
